It s been three months since I began the MA in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences I d like to review the curriculum structure courses I ve taken Full time students usually are to finish this program in 2 semesters technically less than 1 year Sep thru May This is a very time efficient MA degree and it helps to save the living expenses in NYC I chose to finish in two semesters because I don t want to incur extra living expenses as a student in NYC However some full time students would extend to three semesters because they d like to take more classes and have more time for recruiting especially if they re international students One other motivating factor is the tuition cost The third full time semester is called extended residence and only costs around 11 000 This is a bargain compared to the normal semester cost of 28 000 11 000 is even cheaper than quarterly UC tuition for out of state students But students are required to submit a petition for extended residence There s also a catch Students can only take 2 non QMSS courses in the third semesters On degree requirement I ll need to take 9 to 10 classes in total There are five core classes One is a methodology and theory class Two are research seminars One is master thesis One is a stats for social science 4 5 electives can be taken in QMSS or other department as long as they re graduate level courses that cover quantitative methods or research method including nearly all classes in statistics computer sciences and economics The method and theory class is quite useless It s designed to train you think like a researcher but executed taught poorly The two 1 unit seminars are seminars They re good way to learn about new things and motivate me to learn about specific topics That s the benefit of being in a university But don t expect to have a structured concrete learning simply by attending seminars and completing assignments The stats for social sciences has three choices One in QMSS another in Political Sciences and the other would be from statistics department I m taking the QMSS one It covers a lot of things including fitting regression regression diagnostics log transformation interaction logistic regression panel longitudinal PCA and clustering in R The content itself was not ground breaking because I already have taken upper division statistics courses in undergrad But I learned new things here and there when I ask questions during the lectures and labs The final project could also be a good opportunity to work on a side project Unlike most other statistics professors Greg is a good teacher I benefited a lot from observing how he engages students and makes lecture interesting That s something I didn t expect to learn in MA program It s helpful to learn statistical communication teaching and research thinking from him The political sciences one goes more in depth I went to sit in 2 lectures Ben is the instructor It could be dry but very substantial It discusses more time series instrumental variables etc I wish I had stuck with the political sciences class instead of the QMSS and just audit Greg s classes to pick up communication skills I have not taken the thesis course Thesis topics are very flexible Every student seems to tailor it according to personal career goals One benefit of QMSS program is the ability to take courses from other departments including statistics computer sciences operation research economics etc I learned most of my new statistical and technical skills in these elective classes I am taking Stat 4400 Statistical Machine Learning Cunningham and Stat 8307 Communication and Graphics Gelman Both are very substantial Both instructors are highly skilled in teaching Despite the flexibility QMSS students don t have priority in selecting graduate level courses outside of QMSS program You are not guranteed to get that algorithm or linear regression class And there re only 4 5 elective slots if you r here for two semseters The opportunity to take non QMSS classes alone should not drive you to decide on QMSS program Columbia is one of the strongest school in Bayesian Statistics Famous faculty include Andrew Gelman David Madigan Stan is also developed in Columbia If you want to learn Bayesian Columbia and QMSS might be one of your best bets QMSS cohort is very collaborative I enjoy this a lot New York City is a great place to be There are lots of meetups in statistics data science and other things Written by

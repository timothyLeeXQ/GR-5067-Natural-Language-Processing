I am as of right now Fall 2016 in my third and final semester of a master s degree in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences QMSS at Columbia University in New York City There isn t a whole lot of information about this program on the Internet so to those who are giving this program some consideration particularly students from outside the United States here is some helpful information How long is QMSS One year with the option to extend one more semester if you wish Very rarely some people will extend by two semesters these are usually people on externally funded scholarships that have a set timeframe Is it expensive Yep This academic year a full time semester costs 28 780 for up to 20 units One full time class is either 3 or 4 units and the number of units isn t necessarily a function of workload QMSS classes are 4 units It s expensive though cheaper than other quantitative courses such as Mathematics of Finance or Statistics If you choose to extend your stay the additional semester costs 10 944 with the restriction that only up to two non QMSS classes can be taken that semester Scholarships Unfortunately hardly any from within Columbia There might be some merit based scholarships that ll give you like 5 International students are best off seeking external funding In general master s programs that aren t in public policy tend to be very stingy with scholarships they need your money to subsidize the Ph Ds So I can take classes outside the program Hell yeah The only required classes are Theory and Methodology which is a survey class of approaches to quantitative social science that s generally geared towards people who ve never seen social science research before and is pretty boring and old hat otherwise the Research Seminar a two semester sequence where you come in late at night to listen to an academic or practitioner give a talk which may or may not be interesting partially meant to expose you as a student to some of the latest research and practice being done and your master s thesis Everyone has to do a thesis There s no getting around it By the way Statistics students don t have a thesis If theses are your thing e g if you really want to go on to a Ph D go for QMSS Aside from those classes you can take any classes you want outside the program as long as a certain number of them are quantitative If for example you find QMSS s course offerings too easy or you really have a particular substantive topic you re looking to learn more about you can take classes in the Stats CS Engineering Econ PoliSci Sociology and whatever other departments exist at Columbia that ll let you in And most classes will let you in provided there s enough room It s only the super duper high demand ones such as Data Science that won t let you in except if you re in QMSS s Data Science track Track QMSS students are required to pick one of three tracks The Economics track is exactly what it says on the tin it used to function as basically an MA in Econ when Columbia didn t have their MA in Econ yet it was just launched last year The Data Science track lets you into classes offered by the Institute for Data Science and Engineering such as Algorithms for Data Science Machine Learning for Data Science etc And the Traditional track is where everybody else who isn t specializing in the former two tracks goes There s also a fourth track Experiments but to the best of my knowledge practically no one has ever taken that track and it might not even functionally exist anymore I suck at math what do I do QMSS was specifically designed for people with a limited background in quantitative methods I didn t even know what a regression was before I entered the program my own background was in development studies and history Now I wouldn t call myself an expert on anything but I m more comfortable with this stuff and know where to look to go deeper You do need to kinda not suck at math but if you can nail the Graduate Record Examinations you re good Not the math specific GRE just the general quantitative portion I would even say that you can graduate from the program without knowing calculus and linear algebra if you just take all the applied data analysis classes though how much you actually understand would be a valid question How big is the program and what are the people in it like Each cohort ranges from about 60 75 students including part time students About half or so are from East Asia and the other half are from everywhere else though mostly North America Backgrounds range from idiots like myself to people who are already data scientists of some sort For Chinese people in particular especially those who are coming straight from undergrad in China if you re also looking for a program with a good mix of Mandarin and English speakers QMSS is for you By comparison Columbia s Stats program is around 90 Chinese QMSS has an associated student led organization Society for Quantitative Approaches to Social Research QASR that organizes social events alumni networking sessions outreach efforts and the like So what is in QMSS QMSS classes focus on applied quantitative social science There s a three course sequence taught by sociologist and program director Gregory Eirich that starts with applied regression analysis through linear models generalized linear models causal inference methods text mining methods for longitudinal data and time series processes Those classes are light on the technical details and focus on understanding the structure and assumptions of various models and techniques at a high level and putting them to use with data via the open source R programming language This is in contrast with an econometrics class which would cover the same material but with much more theoretical grounding and mathematical proof and much less actual data analysis There s a two course sequence taught by geographical sociologist Jeremy Porter on geographic information systems spatial analysis that essentially teaches you how to work with data with some sort of location information attached It uses the open source software Quantum GIS and the R programming language Other electives include Social Network Analysis also taught by Eirich and Data Visualization which is either a really good or a really crappy class depending on who s teaching it If you re familiar with the Harry Potter series it s like Defense of the Dark Arts the professor changes every year for some reason or another and the syllabus completely changes every year in step There are also two classes taught by political scientist Benjamin Goodrich In the fall Data Mining for Social Science is an introduction to techniques such as tree based models neural networks principal components analysis etc that are commonly used when the goal is to predict new data It s essentially an intro to machine learning class that s decent preparation for more advanced classes and it doubles as an actual introduction to R in the first couple of weeks The other classes use R but this class actually teaches it from the ground up at an accelerated pace In the spring Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences is an introduction to Bayesian modelling which is a different way of approaching a statistical problems that puts heavy emphasis on probability distributions It s the most math heavy class in the program and also doubles as a shameless plug for the statistical modelling language Stan which is being actively developed at Columbia by a team including Goodrich and others which allows the user to specify flexible models for particular situations instead of relying on canned packages Columbia is also the home of Andrew Gelman one of the foremost Bayesian statisticians out there and his influence looms large If none of those sounded exciting to you remember that you don t even have to take any of those classes if you don t want to Already a crackerjack who wants to go full on into machine learning Head over to Stats CS Engineering Want to go into finance Columbia Business School classes can be hard to get into but it s doable Not satisfied with the fairly high level approach of Eirich s classes and want to go really deep into the weeds Either the Econ or PoliSci departments are for you There s also one last thing If you wish QMSS can match you with professors from across the university who are looking for research assistants which is a great opportunity to get your feet wet with social science research outside of a classroom setting I don t want a Ph D I just want a better job or a change of career QMSS is perfect for that as well while initially designed as a Ph D preparation program most people opt to go into industry for at least a while after graduation and the flexible nature of the program allows for diverse interests Data science and analytics are the flavor of the year but policy research tech consulting and finance aren t far behind And for those last two industries in particular there s hardly a better place than New York City QMSS also qualifies as a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics STEM program which for international students who want to work in the United States means that they would qualify for special preferences given to STEM majors How easy would it be for me to find a job Jobs are everywhere for people skilled in quantitative methods Many students in the program aren t even particularly interested in the social science part The barriers to entry are much higher for international students however Columbia University s career office is a great resource with lots of events such as job fairs industry talks and interview prep sessions This being New York though their offerings are heavily skewed towards consulting finance and tech The good news is that larger firms are generally also more open to international hires Part of the reason some people stay for a third semester is to give themselves additional breathing room in the job hunt instead of graduating in May and having to have a full time job within three months or risk losing their visa status they can graduate in December and hopefully score a summer internship beforehand Why shouldn t I just major in Statistics Sure you could In fact if your goal is to get a Ph D in Statistics or to get a top level engineering job in some data science firm then you would need much more quantitative stuff than the average QMSS student learns although you could pursue those same classes within QMSS if you wanted to due to its flexibility Regarding Columbia specifically the primary advantage to QMSS over the Statistics program are that it s slightly cheaper and has 60 75 students as opposed to Stat s 200 meaning that it s easier to raise concerns and get attention from the program administration If your goal is a Ph D in a social science QMSS is excellent preparation Many social science Ph Ds are actually somewhat behind when it comes to quantitative methods despite American social science s heavy focus on it Why would QMSS not be for me The cost is a huge factor honestly Tuition aside cost of living in New York City can be ridiculous Food transportation and that kind of stuff isn t very expensive but rent Barring that it does say quantitative in the title which represents a particular approach to social science that isn t by any means all encompassing If you re interested in being the kind of researcher who can do detailed case studies thick descriptions in depth interviews etc then the program probably isn t for you You might even encounter stuck up people who will scoff at you for your inferior methods though it s not as prevalent as it seems Quantitative methods are generally useful for every social scientist to familiarize themselves with but a program devoted to them isn t for everybody If your bachelor s degree was a fairly quant heavy social science program QMSS will be redundant Finally if you intend to use the program s flexibility to take courses in things like data science it isn t going to be immediately obvious to employers that you ve taken those courses if they see QMSS on your resume Your chosen track isn t reflected on your transcript or diploma So if you really do want to go into something more specific like stats data science you may want to consider going for the degree that actually says stats data science Or you could self study build a portfolio etc On a lighter note Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences is also way too long of a course name Imagine telling someone that in an elevator Hi there I came across your post while doing some research on QMSS at Columbia from what I ve gathered so far it seems like a very good fit given my background and goals My question is how competitive are admissions for QMSS The QMSS page says 20 acceptance rate but that doesn t say much without knowing what the applicant pool is like Was hoping that given you have been through the program you could shed some light on what kind of profiles make it into the program My GRE scores are about in line with the median scores indicated on the QMSS page but my undergrad gpa is fairly average Besides a good statement and letters of recommendation is there anything you think would boost my chances Cheers Hi Dan T I think you have a fairly reasonable shot at getting in I m not aware of anything else other than what you mentioned that would boost your chances but if you have especially extensive experience with either quantitative analysis or with social science I would emphasize those I did not get the impression that QMSS was a particularly highly competitive program but my cohort was quite solid Unfortunately I don t have any special insight into the applicant pool including those who were not accepted I d be happy to try to answer if you have a more specific question Fill in your details below or click an icon to log

In this article you will learn to work with lists in R programming You will learn to create access modify and delete list components List is a data structure having components of mixed data types A vector having all elements of the same type is called atomic vector but a vector having elements of different type is called list We can check if it s a list with typeof function and find its length using length Here is an example of a list having three components each of different data type List can be created using the list function Here we create a list x of three components with data types double logical and integer vector respectively Its structure can be examined with the str function In this example a b and c are called tags which makes it easier to reference the components of the list However tags are optional We can create the same list without the tags as follows In such scenario numeric indices are used by default Lists can be accessed in similar fashion to vectors Integer logical or character vectors can be used for indexing Let us consider a list as follows Indexing with as shown above will give us sublist not the content inside the component To retrieve the content we need to use However this approach will allow us to access only a single component at a time An alternative to which is used often while accessing content of a list is the operator They are both the same except that can do partial matching on tags We can change components of a list through reassignment We can choose any of the component accessing techniques discussed above to modify it Notice below that modification causes reordering of components Adding new components is easy We simply assign values using new tags and it will pop into action We can delete a component by assigning NULL to it

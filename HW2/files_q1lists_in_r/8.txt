 Lists A list is an R structure that may contain object of any other types including other lists Lots of the modeling functions like t test for the t test or lm for linear models produce lists as their return values but you can also construct one yourself mylist list a 1 5 b Hi There c function x x sin x Now the list mylist contains three things named a b and c Their lengths are different a has length 5 b has length 1 and c is a function so it doesn t really have a length Technically it has length 1 just because somebody decided that the length of a function should be one To extract an item from a list you can use the single brackets but that will give you back a list Thus mylist 1 a 1 1 2 3 4 5 mylist 1 1 Can we do math on that Error in mylist 1 1 Non numeric first operand Dumped We can t do math on a list Generally you will want single brackets when you re extracting pieces of a list to make into another list If we want one of the items in its original form we can extract it with double square brackets or by using the dollar sign and the name The items in the list don t need to have names but in this case they do have names since we supplied them at the time we created the list mylist 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 mylist a 1 1 2 3 4 5 mylist a 1 Can we do math on that 1 2 3 4 5 6 Answer yes mylist a 2 What s the second element of the item named a 1 2 Answer 2 mylist a 2 Give me everything from a except the second element 1 1 3 4 5 Remember the negative subscript Usually a list will consist of vectors As always every element of a vector must be of the same type numeric character logical complex A list is a natural way then to store items of different types and lengths For example when you fit a statistical model you might get back a vector of numeric coefficients a logical vector saying which terms were included in the model a matrix of data a vector of messages from the fitting routines a so on A list is the natural way to represent this sort of thing in R Adding items to and deleting items from a list One useful thing about lists is how easily items can be added or deleted To delete an item from a list assign NULL to that item s name or number Furthermore you can add a new element to the list simply by assigning something to a new name These will be added at the end of the list For example mylist Here s what mylist looks like right now a 1 1 2 3 4 5 b 1 Hi There c function x x sin x mylist d New item Add a new item and print out the list mylist We could have assigned to mylist 4 then that a new element would not have had a name 1 1 2 3 4 5 b 1 Hi There c function x x sin x d 1 New item length mylist The length of a list is the number of elements 1 4 So for a data frame the length is the number of columns mylist b NULL Delete item b and print out the list mylist a 1 1 2 3 4 5 c function x x sin x d 1 New item Functions that act on elements of lists This is an important topic that gets its own document See The Apply Family of

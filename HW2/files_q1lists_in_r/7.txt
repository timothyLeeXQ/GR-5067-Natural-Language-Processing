 Follow me on twitter bradleyboehmke A list is an R structure that allows you to combine elements of different types including lists embedded in a list and length Many statistical outputs are provided as a list as well therefore its critical to understand how to work with lists In this section I will guide you throught the basics of managing lists to include To create a list we can use the list function Note how each of the four list items are of different classes integer character logical and numeric and different length To add additional list components to a list we can leverage the list and append functions We can illustrate with the following list If we add the new elements with list it will create a list of two components component 1 will be a nested list of the original list and component 2 will be the new elements added To simply add a 4th list component without creating nested lists we use the append function Alternatively we can also add a new list component by utilizing the sign and naming the new item To add individual elements to a specific list component we need to introduce some subsetting which is further discussed in the subsetting lists section We ll continue with our original l1 list To add additional values to a list item you need to subset for that specific list item and then you can use the c function to add the additional elements to that list item The attributes that you can add to lists include names general comments and specific list item comments Currently our l1 list has no attributes We can add names to lists in two ways First we can use names to assign names to list items in a pre existing list Second we can add names to a list when we are creating a list We can also add comments to lists As previously mentioned comments act as a note to the user without changing how the object behaves With lists we can add a general comment to the list using comment and we can also add comments to specific list items with attr If list x is a train carrying objects then x 5 is the object in car 5 x 4 6 is a train of cars 4 6 RLangTip To subset lists we can utilize the single bracket double brackets and dollar sign operators Each approach provides a specific purpose and can be combined in different ways to achieve the following subsetting objectives To extract one or more list items while preserving1 the output in list format use the operator To extract one or more list items while simplifying1 the output use the or operator One thing that differentiates the operator from the is that the operator can be used with computed indices The operator can only be used with literal names To extract individual elements out of a specific list item combine the or operator with the operator If you have nested lists you can expand the ideas above to extract items and elements We ll use the following list l3 which has a nested list in item 2 If the goal is to subset l3 to extract the nested list item item2a from item2 we can perform this multiple ways Install and load the nycflights13 package Using the flights data provided by this package create the following regression model flight_lm is a list containing various regression results Answer the following questions about this list Its important to understand the difference between simplifying and preserving subsetting Simplifying subsets returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output Preserving subsets keeps the structure of the output the same as the input See Hadley Wickham s section on Simplifying vs Preserving Subsetting to learn more 2

Lists are the R objects which contain elements of different types like numbers strings vectors and another list inside it A list can also contain a matrix or a function as its elements List is created using list function Following is an example to create a list containing strings numbers vectors and a logical values When we execute the above code it produces the following result The list elements can be given names and they can be accessed using these names When we execute the above code it produces the following result Elements of the list can be accessed by the index of the element in the list In case of named lists it can also be accessed using the names We continue to use the list in the above example When we execute the above code it produces the following result We can add delete and update list elements as shown below We can add and delete elements only at the end of a list But we can update any element When we execute the above code it produces the following result You can merge many lists into one list by placing all the lists inside one list function When we execute the above code it produces the following result A list can be converted to a vector so that the elements of the vector can be used for further manipulation All the arithmetic operations on vectors can be applied after the list is converted into vectors To do this conversion we use the unlist function It takes the list as input and produces a vector When we execute the above code it produces the following result

Sceptile was already among the top Grass types a very competitive type with many options With Frenzy Plant Sceptile cements its 2 spot and it s very close to 1 This Hoenn starter is the current best Grass type starter and thus the best Frenzy Plant user With a Mega evolution on the horizon Sceptile is a great investment as a Grass attacker Fury Cutter is preferable over Bullet Seed for its faster energy gains even though the latter has STAB Leaf Blade is one of the best charge moves in the game and with a very low 35 energy cost along with STAB is pretty much mandatory for Sceptile Unlike other Grass type starters Sceptile doesn t need Frenzy Plant but it does provide a harder hitting option The rest of Sceptile s charge moves are optional to provide coverage with most of them being viable depending on the format and your playstyle Earthquake is a very powerful move that provides wide coverage though 65 energy can be a bit expensive Aerial Ace is a lackluster move even against Fighting types Leaf Blade still has a higher DPE but does have a niche against other Grass types Sceptile is one of many Grass type contenders in Great League With an offensive stat distribution and somewhat vulnerable mono Grass typing Sceptile is one of the more fragile and riskier picks What Sceptile does have to offer is the fastest Leaf Blade in the game tied with Farfetch d which lets it pressure shields a bit sooner than any other Grass type Access to Frenzy Plant is a nice addition that gives it some extra power but this doesn t really distinguish Sceptile from its competitors The lack of bulk is notable however and if Leaf Blade is taken out of the equation then Sceptile looks more like a squishier Meganium Overall not a terrific top tier pick though its access to Earthquake and Aerial Ace does give it some coverage in some niche situations The prevalence of Swampert thanks to its Community Day gives Grass types some relevancy in Ultra League and Sceptile is no exception Since a single 35 energy Leaf Blade is approximately a one shot depending on IVs and Sceptile has the fastest access to it there is some incentive to bring the forest Pokemon on the roster Earthquake gives meaningful coverage against the numerous Steel types in this meta as well though not enough to deal with Giratina Overall still a niche pick but its rating will drop if Swampert isn t involved With a max CP of 2757 Sceptile severely lacks the stats needed to do well in Master League While it can still get wins against Swampert Groudon and Kyogre the lack of stats really holds it back from winning most other fights Consider other Pokemon instead How to use You need to know your Pokemon s exact level To find exactly what level your Pokémon is power up your Pokémon following this chart until you re certain of your level from Stardust cost changes A Pokémon s minimum level is 1 Every time you power up your Pokémon gains half a level Copyright C GamePress All Rights Reserved Pokémon is Copyright Gamefreak Nintendo and The Pokémon Company 2001 2018 All images and names owned and trademarked by Gamefreak Nintendo The Pokémon Company and Niantic are property of their respective owners

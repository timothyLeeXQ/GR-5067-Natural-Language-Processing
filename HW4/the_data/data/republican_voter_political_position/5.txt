multiplicity of identities and values But the reality is that in America today how you answer a handful of questions is very likely to determine how you vote This quiz based on recent surveys with more than 140 000 responses presents a series of yes or no questions to predict whether someone is more likely to identify as a Democrat or a Republican It captures divisions that should make you worried about the future of American democracy We won t collect your answers The first question is the most important It s about race Asking whether someone is black Hispanic or Asian cleaves the electorate into two groups Those who answer yes lean Democratic the others are split roughly evenly between the parties Among those who are not black Hispanic or Asian mostly white people the second most important question is whether the person considers religion important If they answer yes they are probably Republican It s not just race and religion though Party allegiances are now also tied to education gender and age Americans have sorted themselves more completely and rigidly than any time in recent history This identity based polarization threatens to make politics less about what the government should do and more about what it means to be an American write John Sides Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck in their book Identity Crisis And while President Trump did not precipitate this shift he exploits and reinforces it with racist and xenophobic rhetoric Racial and religious groups aren t monolithic and one lesson from this project is that identities can intersect in intricate and unexpected ways But today s charged political climate is in large part explained by how neatly demographics divide Democrats and Republicans How demographics predict party affiliation Two questions about race and religion divide the population into distinct categories others about education age and sexuality splinter them further But with the right mix of personal details people who are separated initially can converge near the bottom of this tree Most Democratic The group most likely to be Democrats are black women older than about 30 Meeting in the Middle These groups were initially split by the question about religious importance But they converged near the middle because of their education gender and more Reliable Republicans White religious Protestants lean Republican but those who are male and live in the South are even more likely to identify with the party Most Democratic The group most likely to be Democrats are black women older than about 30 Meeting in the Middle These groups were initially split by the question about religious importance But they converged near the middle because of their education gender and more Reliable Republicans White religious Protestants lean Republican but those who are male and live in the South are even more likely to identify with the party Sorting has occurred on both sides but the Republican Party has tended more toward homogeneity whiter more Christian and more conservative Democrats are a far more diverse party So although the term identity politics is often wielded to criticize the Democrats for focusing on race and gender Republicans are typically more susceptible to appeals based on their shared identity than Democrats according to research by Julie Wronski and Lilliana Mason political scientists at the University of Mississippi and the University of Maryland College Park Personal identities have split the parties From 1968 to 1978 white men who attended church frequently were 6 percentage points more likely to be a Democrat than a Republican From 2008 to 2016 they were 43 points more likely to be Republican The party identification of young unmarried women stayed about the same but the average American became significantly more likely to identify as Republican magnifying the difference between these two groups Polarization has encouraged more straight ticket voting Once a voter might have chosen the Republican presidential candidate but a Democrat for the Senate but now one s whole ballot tends to align with one s presidential preference Polarization has also made voters hesitant to support politicians willing to cooperate with the other side contributing to legislative gridlock Worse the alignment of party preferences with personal identities has fostered ugly tribal politics It s easier to demonize the opposing side when they look nothing like you Voters today like their own party less than ever but are motivated by their even stronger dislike of the other party It doesn t paint a pretty picture Dr Wronski said The partisan gap between black and white voters is the most durable and powerful split in modern American politics Soon after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 he remarked I think we just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a long time to come He wasn t wrong Afterward the Republicans courted racist white voters by opposing school and housing integration Among white people religion is the most stable and important determinant of party choice But the way religion shapes party attachment has changed Today the best way to sort the population of white voters is not by which religion they belong to but by how religious they are Among white Americans Among white Americans Catholics have moved right Religiosity has become more divisive The race gap persists Since at least the 1960s black Americans have overwhelmingly preferred the Democrats White people have moved toward the Republicans Historically white Catholics and Jews were more likely to be Democrats than Protestants But the gap has shrunk as Catholics have moved to the center With the rise of Jerry Falwell s Moral Majority and

Republican Party right now has a sustainable business model said Alan Abramowitz a political scientist at Emory University The party knows this Or at least it should After Republicans lost the 2012 election the party leadership commissioned a report on how to move forward One answer was clear appeal to nonwhite and less conservative voters But in the years since the Republicans led by Mr Trump have doubled down on white identity politics and seem to believe that their path to a majority is through gerrymandering voter suppression or attempts to skew the census College educated white people have left the Republican Party over the past decade but higher income voters are as ever disproportionately Republican Wealthier people tend to be more educated too but now these forces push in opposite directions That complicates the traditional relationship between Democrats and the white working class For decades working class people voted for Democrats but recently the difference in party affiliation between the white working class and other white people has evaporated This trend experts say might make it difficult for the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee to mobilize voters

attributed the emergent diploma divide to less educated white voters racial resentment Dr Sides Dr Tesler and Dr Vavreck argue that during Barack Obama s presidency less educated white people who may not have followed politics began to link the Democrats to progressive attitudes toward race and fled the party as a result Even education is in a sense a proxy for opinions about race the brightest line in today s partisan conflict A person s gender is not especially good at predicting party affiliation at least not on its own When combined with age and marital status though it becomes more relevant Seventy percent of millennial women identify with or lean toward the Democrats according to a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center and about 57 percent of unmarried women leaned Democratic in a 2015 Pew report The gender gap has fluctuated Married people are more Republican The age gap developed recently The early 2000s saw younger voters break for the Democrats possibly because of opinions on the Iraq war The difference between men and women peaked in the mid 1990s and shrank afterward Single voters are increasingly important In 1960 72 percent of U S adults were

Trump researchers have found that hostile sexism measured by asking questions like whether someone believes women seek to control men is increasingly dividing the parties As issues like sexual assault gain prominence in the national political conversation the combination of gender with other characteristics like age and marital status helps predict whether a voter describes himself or herself as a feminist and that directly relates to party affiliation Democrats are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say the country needs more work to achieve gender equality Parties don t just matter in elections They affect how people identify not just the other way around Some people adjust their religious habits to better match their partisanship For example Republicans in search of other Republicans might start attending church more often Put another way people aren t just sorting themselves into parties Parties are sorting people too making cultural and racial rifts wider and harder to bridge And because partisan identities tend to be deeply held political events rarely shake adults party preferences which means the resentment from identity based polarization probably isn t going to spontaneously dissolve In fact it might get worse Dr Abramowitz writes in his book The Great Alignment Race Party Transformation and the Rise of Donald Trump that polarizing forces increased racial diversity the waning influence of religion and the rise of partisan media are far from spent Nathan Kalmoe a political scientist at Louisiana State University has examined political parties during the most divided period in American history the Civil War In his book With Ballots Bullets Partisanship Violence in the American Civil War he demonstrates how newspapers and party leaders encouraged citizens to fight by exploiting their partisan identities fueling a war that killed 750 000 people Though America isn t facing a civil war right now he writes the country is in an uncomfortably similar position today with racial religious partisan alignments political demonization rhetoric rejecting fair elections and even language encouraging violence from prominent leaders including the president Americans he says haven t fully appreciated the potential of party conflict inflamed by social sorting and impetuous leadership to devolve into organized mass violence Partisanship he says has extremes that we haven t recognized Sahil Chinoy is a graphics editor for The New York Times Opinion section The quiz and tree of demographic groups use data from the 2016 2017 and 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study We applied a statistical technique called a regression tree to the self reported party identification of respondents including those who said they leaned toward a party but excluding independents The demographic variables we considered were race religion education age gender sexuality marital status whether the person considers religion very or somewhat important to their life whether they have children under 18 whether they live in the South whether they have ever been a member of a labor union whether they immigrated to the United States and whether they or anyone in their immediate family has served in the United States military The charts of party identification over time use data from the American National Election Studies averaged over each four year period from 1972 to 2018 except the charts of church attendance class income and age which include data only through 2016 They include people who said they leaned toward a party

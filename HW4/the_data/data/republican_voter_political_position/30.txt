Latest Issue Past Issues The GOP is best understood as an insurgency that carried the seeds of its own corruption from the start Updated at 1 44 p m ET on December 14 2018 Why has the Republican Party become so thoroughly corrupt The reason is historical it goes back many decades and in a way philosophical The party is best understood as an insurgency that carried the seeds of its own corruption from the start I don t mean the kind of corruption that regularly sends lowlifes like Rod Blagojevich the Democratic former governor of Illinois to prison Those abuses are nonpartisan and always with us So is vote theft of the kind we ve just seen in North Carolina after all the alleged fraudster employed by the Republican candidate for Congress hired himself out to Democrats in 2010 And I don t just mean that the Republican Party is led by the boss of a kleptocratic family business who presides over a scandal ridden administration that many of his closest advisers are facing prison time that Donald Trump himself might have to stay in office just to avoid prosecution that he could be exposed by the special counsel and the incoming House majority as the most corrupt president in American history Richard Nixon s administration was also riddled with criminality but in 1973 the Republican Party of Hugh Scott the Senate minority leader and John Rhodes the House minority leader was still a normal organization It played by the rules The corruption I mean has less to do with individual perfidy than institutional depravity It isn t an occasional failure to uphold norms but a consistent repudiation of them It isn t about dirty money so much as the pursuit and abuse of power power as an end in itself justifying almost any means Political corruption usually trails financial scandals in its wake the foam is scummy with self dealing but it s far more dangerous than graft There are legal remedies for Duncan Hunter a representative from California who will stand trial next year for using campaign funds to pay for family luxuries But there s no obvious remedy for what the state legislatures of Wisconsin and Michigan following the example of North Carolina in 2016 are now doing Charles J Sykes Wisconsin Republicans are shooting themselves in the foot Republican majorities are rushing to pass laws that strip away the legitimate powers of newly elected Democratic governors while defeated or outgoing Republican incumbents are still around to sign the bills Even if the courts overturn some of these power grabs as they have in North Carolina Republicans will remain securely entrenched in the legislative majority through their own hyper gerrymandering in Wisconsin last month 54 percent of the total votes cast for major party candidates gave Democrats just 36 of 99 assembly seats so they will go on passing laws to thwart election results Nothing can stop these abuses short of an electoral landslide In Wisconsin a purple state that means close to 60 percent of the total vote The fact that no plausible election outcome can check the abuse of power is what makes political corruption so dangerous It strikes at the heart of democracy It destroys the compact between the people and the government In rendering voters voiceless it pushes everyone closer to the use of undemocratic means Today s Republican Party has cornered itself with a base of ever older whiter more male more rural more conservative voters Demography can take a long time to change longer than in progressives dreams but it isn t on the Republicans side They could have tried to expand instead they ve hardened and walled themselves off This is why while voter fraud knows no party only the Republican Party wildly overstates the risk so that it can pass laws including right now in Wisconsin with a bill that reduces early voting to limit the franchise in ways that have a disparate partisan impact This is why when some Democrats in the New Jersey legislature proposed to enshrine gerrymandering in the state constitution other Democrats in New Jersey and around the country objected Taking away democratic rights extreme gerrymandering blocking an elected president from nominating a Supreme Court justice selectively paring voting rolls and polling places creating spurious anti fraud commissions misusing the census to undercount the opposition calling lame duck legislative sessions to pass laws against the will of the voters is the Republican Party s main political strategy and will be for years to come Republicans have chosen contraction and authoritarianism because unlike the Democrats their party isn t a coalition of interests in search of a majority Its character is ideological The Republican Party we know is a product of the modern conservative movement and that movement is a series of insurgencies against the established order Several of its intellectual founders Whittaker Chambers and James Burnham among others were shaped early on by Communist ideology and practice and their Manichean thinking their conviction that the salvation of Western civilization depended on the devoted work of a small group of illuminati marked the movement at its birth David Frum The Republican Party moves beyond hypocrisy The first insurgency was the nomination of Barry Goldwater for president in 1964 He campaigned as a rebel against the postwar American consensus and the soft middle of his own party s leadership Goldwater didn t use the standard reassuring lexicon of the big tent and the mainstream At the San Francisco convention he embraced extremism and denounced the Republican establishment whose moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue His campaign lit a fire of excitement that spread to millions of readers through the pages of two self published prophesies of the apocalypse Phyllis Schlafly s A Choice Not an Echo and John A Stormer s None Dare Call It Treason According to these mega sellers the political opposition wasn t just wrong it was a sinister conspiracy with totalitarian goals William F Buckley the movement s Max Eastman its most brilliant pamphleteer predicted Goldwater s landslide defeat His candidacy like the revolution of 1905 had come too soon but it foretold the victory to come At a Young Americans for Freedom convention Buckley exhorted an audience of true believing cadres to think beyond November Presuppose that the fiery little body of dissenters of which you are a shining meteor suddenly spun off no less than a majority of all the American people who suddenly overcome a generation s entrenched lassitude suddenly penetrated to the true meaning of freedom in society where the truth is occluded by the verbose mystification of thousands of scholars tens of thousands of books a million miles of newsprint Then Goldwater s inevitable defeat would turn into the well planted seeds of hope which will flower on a great November day in the future if there is a future The insurgents were agents of history and history was long To avoid despair they needed the clarity that only ideology the truth can give The task in 1964 was to recruit and train conservative followers Then established institutions that concealed the truth schools universities newspapers the Republican Party itself would have to be swept away and replaced or entered and cleansed Eventually Buckley imagined an electoral majority but these were not the words and ideas of democratic politics with its ungainly coalitions and unsatisfying compromises During this first insurgency the abiding contours of the movement took shape One feature detailed in Before the Storm Rick Perlstein s account of the origins of the New Right was liberals inability to see let alone take seriously enough to understand what was happening around the country For their part conservatives nursed a victim s sense of grievance the system was stacked against them cabals of the powerful were determined to lock them out and they showed more energetic interest than their opponents in the means of gaining power mass media new techniques of organizing rhetoric ideas Finally the movement was founded in the politics of racism Goldwater s strongest support came from white southerners reacting against civil rights Even Buckley once defended Jim Crow with the claim that black Americans were too backward for self government Eventually he changed his views but modern conservatism would never stop flirting with hostility toward whole groups of Americans And from the start this stance opened the movement to extreme sometimes violent fellow travelers Peter Beinart Why Trump supporters believe he is not corrupt It took only 16 years with the election of Ronald Reagan for the movement and party to merge During those years conservatives hammered away at institutional structures denouncing the established ones for their treacherous liberalism and building alternatives in the form of well funded right wing foundations think tanks business lobbies legal groups magazines publishers professorships When Reagan won the presidency in 1980 the products of this counter establishment from the title of Sidney Blumenthal s book on the subject were ready to take power Reagan commanded a revolution but he himself didn t have a revolutionary character He didn t think the public needed to be indoctrinated and organized only heard But conservatism remained an insurgent politics during the 1980s and 90s and the more power it amassed in government business law media the more it set itself against the fragile web of established norms and delighted in breaking them The second insurgency was led by Newt Gingrich who had come to Congress two years before Reagan became president with the avowed aim of overthrowing the established Republican leadership and shaping the minority party into a fighting force that could break Democratic rule by shattering what he called the corrupt left wing machine Gingrich liked to quote Mao s definition of politics as war without blood He made audiotapes that taught Republican candidates how to demonize the opposition with labels such as disgrace betray and traitors When he became speaker of the House at the head of yet another revolution Gingrich announced There will be no compromise How could there be when he was leading a crusade to save American civilization from its liberal enemies Even after Gingrich was driven from power the victim of his own guillotine he regularly churned out books that warned of imminent doom unless America turned to a leader like him he once called himself teacher of the rules of civilization among other exalted epithets Unlike Goldwater and Reagan Gingrich never had any deeply felt ideology It was hard to say exactly what American civilization meant to him What he wanted was power and what he most obviously enjoyed was smashing things to pieces in its pursuit His insurgency started the conservative movement on the path to nihilism Tom Nichols Why I m leaving the Republican party The party purged itself of most remaining moderates growing ever more shallow as it grew ever more conservative from Goldwater who in 1996 joked that he had become a Republican liberal to Ted Cruz from Buckley to Dinesh D Souza Jeff Flake the outgoing senator from Arizona whose conservative views come with a democratic temperament describes this deterioration as a race to the bottom to see who can be meaner and madder and crazier It is not enough to be conservative anymore You have to be vicious The viciousness doesn t necessarily reside in the individual souls of Republican leaders It flows from the party s politics which seeks to delegitimize opponents and institutions purify the ranks through purges and coups and agitate followers with visions of apocalypse all in the name of an ideological cause that every year loses integrity as it becomes indistinguishable from power itself The third insurgency came in reaction to the election of Barack Obama it was the Tea Party Eight years later it culminated in Trump s victory an insurgency within the party itself because revolutions tend to be self devouring I m not willing to preside over people who are cannibals Gingrich declared in 1998 when he quit the House In the third insurgency the features of the original movement surfaced again more grotesque than ever paranoia and conspiracy thinking racism and other types of hostility toward entire groups innuendos and incidents of violence The new leader is like his authoritarian counterparts abroad illiberal demagogic hostile to institutional checks demanding and receiving complete acquiescence from the party and enmeshed in the financial corruption that is integral to the political corruption of these regimes Once again liberals failed to see it coming and couldn t grasp how it happened Neither could some conservatives who still believed in democracy The corruption of the Republican Party in the Trump era seemed to set in with breathtaking speed In fact it took more than a half century to reach the point where faced with a choice between democracy and power the party chose the latter Its leaders don t see a dilemma democratic principles turn out to be disposable tools sometimes useful sometimes inconvenient The higher cause is conservatism but the highest is power After Wisconsin Democrats swept statewide offices last month Robin Vos speaker of the assembly explained why Republicans would have to get rid of the old rules We are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in As Bertolt Brecht wrote of East Germany s ruling party Would it not be easier In that case for the government To dissolve the people And elect another This article originally stated that Duncan Hunter was defeated in his bid for reelection We want to hear what you think about this article

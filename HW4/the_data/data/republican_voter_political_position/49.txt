Democratic Primary Election Here is a quick guide to the candidates See candidate debates on KET GOVERNOR Matt Bevin incumbent Ralph Alvarado At a Republican fundraiser in Murray incumbent Governor Matt Bevin joked that sometimes being governor is analogous to being in the barn in the springtime especially if it s been a long winter Stuff just piles up He added this is a season of shoveling That season he said has been going on for the more than three years he has been in office He said he hopes to continue to have the opportunity because he is optimistic that at some point some future governor is going to get to ride the pony He says his reelection message to teachers affected by the pension issue is that the vast majority are retirees or are hoping to someday be retirees and are supportive of his efforts to reform the pension system He says he s the only governor who has ever fully funded their pensions that no one else has ever led the charge on it For every person who s scared and or confused there are dozens and dozens that are grateful that somebody s actually fighting to fund their pension he said Bevin calls his pension reform efforts a legal and moral obligation to deliver on the promise made to state employees He says the only way to deliver on that promise is to change the structure for future employees because it is not financially possible to keep doing in the future what has been done to this point He pledges to keep fighting and to do the dirty work He says his work requirements for Medicaid policy is an effort to get able bodied working age men and women back to work He says he wants everyone Kentucky to have a job whether they want one or not with an exception for people who are gainfully retired The policy requires people to work volunteer or undergo job training for 20 hours a week We want people to have the satisfaction the dignity of doing for themselves he said and that comes coupled with job growth in the state Bevin s campaign has not responded to an interview request WKMS News interviewed Bevin s running mate Senator Ralph Alvarado about the campaign State senator Ralph Alvarado says Bevin has been a busy governor representing the state well around the country He says Bevin sells the state in bringing jobs and economic opportunity and is able to represent Kentucky with the federal government attracting grants Alvarado says the top priority is to continue the economic trajectory that we re on It s been tremendous what we ve accomplished in this state in the last three years in partnering between the Bevin administration and what we ve been able to do in the General Assembly 50 000 new jobs have been created in the state We ve got I think the lowest unemployment rate in two generations over 19 billion dollars now He touted economic development and workforce development investment There s almost more jobs out there than workers so we have to make Kentucky grow Alvarado said Make it a place where others want to come do And then people that are able to work and are wanting to work make sure they have the jobs and they can go out there and earn a good living for their family He says Bevin is arguably the most pro life governor in the union and Kentucky is one of the most pro life states in the union He says Bevin will continue to defend the rights of the unborn Alvarado says Kentucky needs to create job opportunities for coal miners in the eastern part of the state ravaged by the reduction in coal production He wants to make sure those miners can earn 75 000 to 80 000 and up He suggests these could be technical and manufacturing jobs for example at automotive and aluminum plants He says the Bevin agenda tends to promote American ideals which he explains is the inherent worth of the individual and the ability for someone to achieve whatever they want to achieve through the dignity of work Another issue is health care Alvarado says He wants to make sure jobs can provide health care for individuals The governor has worked really hard to help reduce the number of people off of Medicaid rolls so they can get them into normal employment and normal private insurance He says 72 000 people have come off those rolls this past year just because they ve been able to find jobs saving the state 300 million in Medicaid costs Alvarado says the Bevin administration wants to encourage adults to gain trade skills for manufacturing jobs For some reason in society we ve gotten to the point where we don t equate a trade to a college degree and I think we ve got to start getting used to that He says sometimes people with college degrees struggle to earn a living after graduation while people learning trades like plumbers carpenters and HVAC specialists are making much more in salary He wants society to treat trade skills like a college degree Another issue is trying to get people to be more computer savvy in the state opening up potential for jobs in the IT industry We re working toward that Alvarado said suggesting rural broadband initiatives Alvarado says he personally has a reputation of filing a lot of bills and experience getting a lot of bills across the finish line He says others either don t have experience in the General Assembly or haven t had a lot of success in that regard He says Bevin s success and proven track record speaks volumes and nobody can deny the results A vote for Bevin will continue that trajectory he says If the state wants to continue to move forward I think this is the opportunity said Alvarado I think any other alternative is going to be a step backwards in where this state needs to go He said Bevin is a governor that s taken on tough assignments things that no one else wants to talk about or do He said a lot of them just want to say yes be popular ignore the problem and kick it down the road He said Bevin has taken on pension reforms trying to create tax reforms and has never shied away from this He says he tries to get there not with popularity in mind but with success in mind Bevin discussed his campaign at a GOP dinner in Murray Profile on Matt Bevin by Kentucky Public Radio Capitol Reporter Ryland Barton Campaign website Robert Goforth Michael Hogan Robert Goforth is a state Representative for Laurel Jackson and Madison Counties He served in the US Army and has a background in pharmacy He says seeing the scourge of drugs affecting children prompted him to decide to run for the legislature He says his top priorities are dealing with the pension issue and the drug epidemic He says he also wants to focus on tax reform education and health care We have to bring everybody together to solve the tough challenges for Kentucky Goforth said and added that Kentucky needs a different approach than how it s been handled so far He credits his legislative experience for making him qualified for the position and says he has a vision for Kentucky a plan to go down a different road than what we ve been down the same old failed attempts When asked what his answer or solution is to solving the pension issue Goforth said he co sponsored HB504 last session that saves the defined benefit plan for teachers saves more money than the so called sewer bill passed last year and said it s a good solution for the pension issue for teachers Then there needs to be funding for KERS he said We need to find better sources to invest our dollars since this governor has been the governor he s supposed to be investing our dollars wisely yet that pension board has paid out 400 million dollars in management fees in 2016 17 and 18 to his hedge fund cronies So we need to get a better return on our money for less fees On Bevin s recent veto of the pension relief bill for universities and quasis Goforth said There again it just proves you can t believe a word Matt Bevin says He sent us a letter in the legislature that he was wanting and urging the legislature to pass the bill I knew it was a bad bill to begin with There s a loophole that people s pensions public employees pensions in these quasis their pensions would be in jeopardy and he still urged them to pass the bill I think it s a political stunt because he realized that there s more employees than administrators that were against the bill than for it Goforth says the Democrats in the governor s race don t represent the values that most of us in Kentucky represent but rather the same old failed policies and political values that we ve seen in the past He says they don t believe in standing up for the right for life the unborn and they don t believe in people defending themselves When asked about Rocky Adkins running as a pro life candidate Goforth said Adkins voted against pro life legislation He says he believes the Republican Party has experienced great successes over the past several years but those are in great danger due to Bevin s low approval rating He says the party is bigger than one person and says Kentucky deserves to have a governor that shares conservative values He has filed a fetal heartbeat bill and says he s the first state legislator to file a bill to make it a felony to perform an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected He also filed what he describes as conservative Second Amendment legislation that says one should never be defenseless if they are a law abiding trained citizen with a permit Goforth says the pension system can be fixed in a fair and just way He says Common Core needs to be repealed He says revenue doesn t need to be raised through predatory casino style gambling or on the backs of hard working Kentuckians And says billions are wasted in Frankfort due to politics We can be pro business and pro worker at the same time Goforth said We have to make sure some of those rights go to those in the breakroom and not just the board room Profile on Bevin s primary challengers by Kentucky Public Radio member station WFPL Campaign website Ike Lawrence James Anthony Rose A self employed businessman in real estate from Lexington Ike Lawrence says he started the city s Town and Gown Commission He says his business model involves buying distressed student properties and raising the bar He says he s trying to fix Town and Gown problems the University of Kentucky has put on citizens He says the community is losing kids due to injury and death due to alcohol problems Lawrence says Governor Matt Bevin is big at bringing companies from the outside to grow the economy but says two haven t come to fruition an aluminum plant and a battery plant He says the state has lost millions in trying to bring them here And says the money going to these investments should go back to the communities He predicts this would be about 330 000 per county which could be used to help grow small and medium size businesses rather than the promise of large companies that may never break ground I m a big believer that this economic development that comes out the treasury and the governor s office isn t working he said The taxes they pay are deferred for 10 to 20 years So we lose money from the treasury The numbers as far as salary are inflated Nobody s going to pay lineworkers 75 000 times 400 workers and expect to compete against the Chinese and Japanese to sell aluminum unless these numbers are really inflated Lawrence says he s not too different from Bevin I do philosophically think that he s just hitting the tip of the iceberg The opioid and fentanyl problem and the pension problem He said however he would tackle the whole iceberg not just the top two percent On school issues Lawrence says he s big on tough love in high schools and middle schools raising the bar through a higher dress code and mandatory turning off of cell phones during school hours He believes in making changes to campus policies with regard to alcohol and leveling out the tuition from freshman to senior year with no tuition increases He says he s pro right to work He doesn t believe the inviolable contract extends beyond the original contract All the add ons from the past 29 years although they ve received it I don t think they re protected He says defined benefit plans need to change because people are living longer and because of economies of scale you have to change things and give back a little bit so future beneficiaries can receive Lawrence says his 40 year resume is all business and about fixing things He says he goes after issues that people typically don t go after such as real liberalism and wants to take this experience statewide Profile on Bevin s primary challengers by Kentucky Public Radio member station WFPL Campaign website William Woods Justin Miller William Woods has not responded to an interview request and hasn t appeared at the campaign events WKMS News has attended Profile on Bevin s primary challengers by Kentucky Public Radio member station WFPL Campaign Facebook page ATTORNEY GENERAL Daniel Cameron Attorney Daniel Cameron says his biggest priority is re establishing the office in its proper place as the chief law enforcement office in Kentucky We ve got a huge drug epidemic here We ve lost 1 565 individuals to drug overdoses in the commonwealth And I m hoping the next Attorney General and I m hoping that that is me needs to focus on that issue primarily Measuring success comes down to reducing that number he says Cameron also wants an Attorney General who stands up for First and Second Amendment rights and the rights of the unborn I think that s a really really important issue as we move into the next decade he said It s also important he says that we have an Attorney General who is not suing the governor at every turn He says the current Attorney General has found himself suing the governor on every piece of consequential legislation that has been passed in the General Assembly When asked if voters elect him AG and a Democrat wins the governor s race if he d fight the governor at every turn Cameron said he d abide by his principles but at the end of the day you re supposed to uphold and enforce the laws that are passed by the General Assembly He added that public safety doesn t have an R or D so he is happy to work with whomever on that issue Cameron says he has long relationships with Kentucky law enforcement He served as Senator Mitch McConnell s general counsel for two and a half years and says he s proud to have worked with him to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the U S Supreme Court He says he has worked with various law enforcement agencies in the state Profile on GOP Attorney General candidates by Kentucky Public Radio Capitol Reporter Ryland Barton Campaign website Wil Schroder State Senator Wil Schroder says he is a pro life advocate and it s time we had a pro life Attorney General He says the drug epidemic continues to wreak havoc across Kentucky He also supports constitutional rights particularly the First and Second Amendment Standing up for pro life legislation I mean our current Attorney General hasn t even put up a fight I ve stood up against groups like Planned Parenthood and ACLU as state Senator and I ll continue to do so again as Attorney General he said As for the drug epidemic Schroder wants a conversation more dialogue with county attorneys commonwealth attorneys and law enforcement on the issue He says he s the only candidate who has been a prosecutor as assistant commonwealth s attorney for Campbell County before serving in the state Senate As Attorney General I m going to be deciding things not based on political influence or what s popular politically he said People have asked me well what if it s not a Republican governor It s not going to matter I m going to be approaching things from a compass of what does the constitution say What does the U S constitution say what does the Kentucky constitution say and what does the law say And those will guide my decision making Profile on GOP Attorney General candidates by Kentucky Public Radio Capitol Reporter Ryland Barton Campaign website SECRETARY OF STATE Michael Adams Former McConnell aide and a native of Paducah Michael Adams says west Kentucky never gets the attention it deserves and says he ll be an advocate for the region He says he s the only one on both tickets that has election experience He has a national Republican election law practice in Kentucky and is Vice President Mike Pence s attorney for political law Adams says his highest priority is restoring dignity and honor to the office of Secretary of State He says incumbent Democrats have scandalized the office His biggest policy priority is requiring a photo identification to vote Adams also wants to clean up the voter rolls We have numerous counties in Kentucky that have more registered voters than voting age citizens There s a process in federal and state law for cleaning those voter rolls up but it s not been followed by the incumbent Democrats and I want to fix that He says automatic voter registration is a recipe for fraud and corruption He also opposes multilingual ballots because they are very costly to the county and caters to people who are not citizens Campaign website Andrew English Attorney Andrew English is a military officer has spent six years active duty in the Navy is currently lieutenant commander in the reserves has run an office of more than 40 lawyers paralegals and investigators for the past the years as the general counsel for the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet English says the Secretary of State s office is in trouble right now and needs someone to come in and rebuild His first priority is to rebuild relationship with state board of elections and county clerks offices After that he says voter ID is needed and voter rolls need to be cleaned up He says the business side of the office involving LLCs and corporation documentation doesn t get much attention but needs a plan Kentucky One Stop needs to be modernized he says We have so much potential in the state we need to create that entrepreneurial spirit especially out here in western Kentucky making sure people are taking advantage of all those economic opportunities that are coming to the commonwealth He wants to make this process as easy as possible to spur economic development Voter ID will need to be a piece of legislation similar to Indiana s laws he says As for cleaning the voting rolls he says there s a process in place right now but is needs to be automated We need somebody in there who can actually lead and understands that look you have to put the right people in the right places and you have to have a team in that office and that team expands out to the county clerks and the state board of elections he said Campaign website Stephen Knipper Former Erlanger city councilman Stephen Knipper ran for Secretary of State in 2015 against Alison Lundergan Grimes and lost He says many of the same issues he championed then are relevant today Knipper wants to clean the voter rolls He says 48 counties lack supervision over this He says he was alarmed to learn voter data was sold on the dark web He says there is a lot of room for a good time if you have a bad heart when it comes to illegally assuming people s identities to vote in Kentucky suggesting such activity has occurred in past elections in the state He noted he mentioned this in 2015 and now it s the number one issue He says a vote for Knipper is a vote for someone who can operate in the office right away knows the plan and how to clean up the rolls He credits his experience working with large companies and considers not being an attorney a big plus because it offers some innovation On other issues Knipper is an advocate for adoption because he and his wife adopted five children from China which he said was a laborious process You talk about an education in bureaucracy Oh my goodness He wants to streamline the process Knipper said Democrats running for Secretary of State will have a hard time separating themselves from Alison Lundergan Grimes track record Campaign website Carl Nett Carl Nett is a trained criminal investigator with a background in the U S Secret Service as a member of the Presidential Protection Division He says he is the only trained intelligence and counterintelligence officer in the race and that this makes him qualified to take on new and emerging threats to elections from foreign intelligence agencies He said he led a unit for the Pentagon at a U S naval station in Guantanamo Bay dealing with the Office of Military Commissions He says he d bring the same level of expertise and discretion to the office Nett s top priority is to clean up the voter rolls He says the law has not been adhered to by the incumbent He wants to follow a model that was implemented out of state and approved by the Supreme Court which is to go through and look at those who have been dormant for two federal election cycles send them a pre paid postage mailer that asks if they re still a resident of Kentucky And if we don t get a response we wait two more years and if they haven t voted then a full decade then we purge the voter rolls citing change of address Nett further explained If they haven t voted already in eight years two federal election cycles then that should be a red flag of possibly having moved out of the state or never having existed or being an illegal alien or being deceased I would make the case to everyone that what we want out of government particularly in this role as chief election official is someone who s going to be faithful to the law is someone who is going to operate with integrity is someone who is going to make sure every vote counts with equal weight and is going to make sure that we police our elections and keep them fair and honest That s what we should all want as Americans Campaign website COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE Ryan Quarles Incumbent Commissioner of Agriculture Ryan Quarles wants to continue to grow Kentucky Proud getting beef and meat into grocery stores in a significant way Quarles wants to continue to expand industrial hemp That s a signature achievement during my first term He says 1 000 farmers are growing and 120 companies are involved Because Kentucky chose to lead on this and now that the recent Farm Bill legalized the crop he says Kentucky will play a pivotal role in developing the national framework and creating jobs He wants to make sure Kentucky is an advocate for agriculture from food literacy to expanding farmers markets and playing defense against ridiculous legislation like the Green New Deal which he says targets cow farts He said there are also unfair targets to the beef industry with fake meat He says success would be an increase in people using Kentucky Proud and the overall quality of the programs Another measure would be job creation and economic development through industrial hemp As for being an advocate in preventing bad things from happening and educating consumers he said this one is hard to measure but making sure that when the two percent of the population that feeds the rest of America is appreciated and included in conversations that s a success for agriculture not just in Kentucky but nationwide Quarles says he would continue to be active in eastern Kentucky which he says has a tremendous amount of timber This would include having discussions with the growing bourbon industry to make sure that Kentucky has enough white oak so as that industry continues to grow and that they buy Kentucky timber first He added that eastern Kentucky has a reputation for doing more with less He says he s proud of his track record being active with the state legislature Also he says he s well connected with the U S Department of Agriculture He says it s important Kentucky has someone who grew up on a family farm and has dirt on their boots to serve as state Commissioner of Agriculture Quarles says he believes in the free market and says Democratic challengers want to impose unnecessary bureaucracy on the hemp industry He says this industry doesn t need to be restricted but rather unleashed He says the state Department of Agriculture is more than cows plows and sows It plays a consumer protection role It also cracks down on credit card skimmers at gas pumps across the state Elect someone that knows ag but also understands that they re looking out for consumers as well and over the past three plus years we have a track record that I believe would make Kentucky proud he said Campaign website Bill Polyniak Bill Polyniak has six years of experience in hemp farming He says he was the fifth person in the state s hemp pilot program We ve seen thousands of people helped So I d like to use my experience that I ve already used to help Kentucky farmers but to expand that experience and use it at the Kentucky Department of Agriculture to really put forth what I would say is the finest quality program in the United States Polyniak says his first top priority is hemp getting farmers really on board with what they need to do to be successful in hemp He says there s a lot of fake news that suggests hemp is doing well but says Kentucky is destroying hemp that is helping people He would define success in this regard as farmers getting paid and building quality products Right now when you look at the hemp industry we have a lot of products showing up on store shelves and Marathon and gas stations and stuff and when you look at the success people are having on CBD it s not because they re buying those products in gas stations He says he wants to get Kentucky farmers moving forward so they can be successful and that plan doesn t exist today He says he s the only candidate that has the leadership experience to put forth a plan rather than a guess Campaign website AUDITOR Mike Harmon unopposed Incumbent state auditor Mike Harmon says his top priority if reelected is to continue the work he s been doing the past three years in office Harmon says he feels he s moved the office in the right direction and conducted historic audits He referenced the first audit of the Administrative Office of the Courts where they issued 20 fines and found that one of the justices was leasing space from a company owned by his two sons Harmon says the lease was three times more expensive than the next closest bid Harmon also harkened back to 2018 Kentucky Wired audit which found an originally 30 million investment bumped up to 1 5 billion by former Governor Steve Beshear Harmon says his office has released data bulletins to condense information in a way that s accessible to the public He named the debt data bulletin as an example which showed the state had 54 6 billion dollars in debt He said 80 was unfunded pension liability That s almost 12 300 for every man woman and child in the state of Kentucky That helps the average citizen grasp better what situation that we re in Harmon said Harmon says he s spent 13 years in Kentucky General Assembly He says his office has been able to advance several pieces of legislation to make the state efficient effective and ethical In 2018 they advanced Senate Bill 144 also called the AUP bill which allows sheriffs and county clerks to opt for an agreed upon procedures audit rather than a full financial statement audit if they had a clean audit the previous year Harmon says this saves counties 25 50 on cost of audits and allows for better use of assets Harmon says he has more experience than his Democratic opponents with a background in banking and insurance He says he doesn t have any personal agenda in the Auditor s office and says its important to follow the data It s important for the Auditor when he steps into the office to take the partisan hat off and put on the independent non partisan hat Harmon said Campaign website TREASURER Allison Ball unopposed Incumbent state Treasurer Allison Ball says she believes the job is about being a watchdog over taxpayer dollars She says she s tried to restore that as an emphasis of the office in cutting spending and catching fraud attempts Ball says she s returned more unclaimed property dollars than any other Treasurer in the same period of time She says she has returned more than 73 million dollars That s something that I actually have ideas on how to improve she said I ve improved it while I ve been in office and there s other things that I want to do that will identify people so that they don t always have to come to me that I ll be able to find them and return the money Ball was a bankruptcy attorney before becoming Treasurer She says she got to see firsthand the need for financial literacy in Kentucky and wants to tackle this issue Last year she championed a bill to make it a requirement for high school students to have a financial literacy course before graduation This past year she supported a bill to make a Commission on Financial Literacy led by the Treasury office for resources for teachers to teach financial literacy She says the office will use the private sector for this adding that it does not involve taxpayer dollars She says they ll partner with credit unions Ball is also an advocate for encouraging women to run for office and to take on leadership roles She says it helps to see a young mom such as herself doing an important job like state Treasurer that both can be done and done well She wants to encourage women to jump in and do more because we need their voices across Kentucky She says people know what kind of treasurer she is and says it helps people in making their decision at the poll She says the role has an opportunity to be transparent and says she launched a transparency website You want people in office who believe in transparency That s something I ve done And of course financial literacy is something that I have recognized as something we need in Kentucky she said adding that she also launched a database that categorizes financial literacy resources in Kentucky The job is a watchdog for taxpayer dollars It s not necessarily a political role It s a core function of government role You want somebody who understands the fiscal elements of the role she said Campaign Facebook page This post will be updated as the Primary Election nears

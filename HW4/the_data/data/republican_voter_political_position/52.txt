Ballotpedia a single party has an absolute grip on power in 19 states controlling the governorship as well as veto proof majorities in their legislatures Democrats are powerless minorities in 16 such states while Republicans are completely shut out in California Oregon and Illinois In California fewer than a quarter of registered voters today are Republicans and Democrats have a supermajority in the legislature In recent months Democratic Gov Gavin Newsom has cast Republicans as xenophobes and nativists destined for the waste bin of history For many in the GOP here it feels like they ve been set out on the curb with the trash In interviews California Republicans describe themselves as disenfranchised lonely a remnant and not part of the conversation Huntington Beach Mayor Erik Peterson says he finds the situation increasingly frustrating With no influence in Sacramento Republicans can t affect regulations which he personally feels in his own business as an electrical contractor They can t block tax increases or effectively shape the budget which just extended health care to young unauthorized immigrants So they resort to fighting through the courts says the mayor It s the only thing we can do To understand what it s like to be a Republican in California today spend some time in Huntington Beach In January Democratic Gov Gavin Newsom announced a lawsuit against this once solidly Republican community for violating a state law to allow more housing The suit came on the heels of the city s courtroom victory claiming exemption from California s sanctuary state law a ruling the state is now appealing The governor is 100 singling out Huntington Beach says Mayor Erik Peterson The city s attorney agrees pointing out that 50 other cities have not fulfilled the housing mandate I believe they re still upset that we beat them on the sanctuary issue says the mayor from his office a surf board propped up in the corner Of course we re all racists because of that that s what they tell us But it actually had nothing to do with illegal immigration It had to do with the state s overreach Last year Orange County the cradle of California conservatism lost four of its congressional seats to Democrats Fewer than a quarter of California s registered voters today are Republicans and Democrats have a supermajority that renders the GOP powerless in the legislature In recent months Governor Newsom has cast Republicans as xenophobes and nativists destined for the waste bin of history For many in the GOP here it feels like they ve been set out on the curb with the trash In interviews California Republicans describe themselves as disenfranchised lonely a remnant and not part of the conversation Huntington Beach s mayorship is technically a nonpartisan position But as a Republican in a deep blue state Mayor Peterson says he finds the situation increasingly frustrating With no influence in Sacramento Republicans can t affect regulations which he personally feels in his own business as an electrical contractor They can t block tax increases or effectively shape the budget which just extended health care to young unauthorized immigrants So they resort to fighting through the courts says the mayor It s the only thing we can do Extreme minority status is a common condition in divided America According to Ballotpedia a single party has an absolute grip on power in 19 states controlling the governorship as well as veto proof majorities or supermajorities in their legislatures Democrats are powerless minorities in 16 such states while Republicans are completely shut out in California Oregon and Illinois Last month Republican state senators in Oregon fled to Idaho to deny Democrats a quorum and a vote on a sweeping climate change bill The bill petered out much to the delight of Republicans Wisconsin state Sen Jon Erpenbach had a similar experience though it didn t end as well In 2011 he and 13 fellow Senate Democrats went into exile in Illinois for three weeks in order to delay consideration of a major anti union bill The bill was being pushed by then Gov Scott Walker and the Republican dominated legislature Ultimately the bill became law As a voiceless minority you feel very very disenfranchised says Mr Erpenbach You use every possible parliamentary tool to stop what they do and 9 times out of 10 you lose What distresses Mr Erpenbach most is that Wisconsin is overall a purple state but that parity is not reflected in the legislature because of gerrymandered voting districts Voters last year elected a Democrat as a governor restoring balance in government as Mr Erpenbach puts it but not before the GOP legislature used a lame duck session to restrict the incoming governor s powers Whether it s the Democrats in a supermajority or the Republicans in a supermajority it seems like the parties are just more concerned about 50 1 of the people that enough people will elect them and keep them in a majority says Mr Erpenbach As in California the minority party in Wisconsin turned to the courts to try to remedy partisan redistricting and the diminished governorship They ve lost on both counts Mr Erpenbach says Democrats have no choice but to continue plugging away at the redistricting message educating voters so that when representatives go home they hear about it Republicans in California meanwhile can t agree on how to restore their voice It s been a long decline precipitated many observers believe by Republican Gov Pete Wilson in the 1990s He went against demographic trends and pushed anti immigration measures In the short term it won him reelection but it also drove Latinos into the arms of Democrats Other factors also came into play but with white people now a minority in California and Donald Trump in the White House Republicans are struggling in this deeply blue state The state GOP needs to stop fighting the culture wars and instead present itself as a more mainstream party that focuses on pocketbook issues as well as education and the environment says Bill Whalen former speechwriter for Governor Wilson Republican consultant Mike Madrid blasts California Republicans for their silence on President Trump s racist tweets about four Democratic women of color in the House On the other hand Fred Whitaker chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County rejects the idea that Republicans should adjust their ideology You can t become the Democratic Party lite he says Many Asians and Latinos are socially conservative but fiscally liberal when it comes to larger government he says Our job is to talk with every voter where they are who align with our values and see if we can t bring them across The party must also field more candidates who look like the neighborhoods they come from he says He and others believe that the state is headed for a financial crisis It may have a surplus now but it relies on high income taxes and when the next recession hits they say voters will see the error of their ways Voters wanted a Democratic majority in statewide offices and in the legislature and now they have a high tax state with rising gas taxes and the highest rate of poverty in the nation says Republican state Sen John Moorlach who represents Huntington Beach When a recession hits it s not going to be pretty California s Democrats won supermajority status last November But Mr Moorlach says he s not complaining about his new situation It is what it is que sera sera And he says at least Democrats have allowed him to have a voice whether in committee or on the Senate floor As vice chair of the powerful Energy Utilities and Communications Committee he realizes he s pretty much a figurehead but he still contributes Votes tend not to go the way he wants but he has a chance to put things on record It s not completely hopeless for Republicans adds Marcia Godwin a government expert at the University of La Verne in La Verne California Sometimes bipartisan coalitions form in Sacramento when the liberal wing of the Democratic Party won t go along she says And at the local level there s still a fairly high amount of influence in the areas where Republicans are concentrated such as in Orange County Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox Asked whether supermajorities in one party states are bad for democracy or simply a reflection of the will of the people she replies What s good for democracy is the possibility of change Even if it s not the next election maybe 10 years from now there might be change

 The Republican Party also referred to as the GOP Grand Old Party is one of the two major political parties in the United States the other is its historic rival the Democratic Party The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas Nebraska Act which allowed for the potential expansion of slavery into certain U S territories The party supported classical liberalism opposed the expansion of slavery and supported economic reform 14 15 Abraham Lincoln was the first Republican president Under the leadership of Lincoln and a Republican Congress slavery was banned in the United States in 1865 The Party was generally dominant during the Third Party System and the Fourth Party System After 1912 the Party underwent an ideological shift to the right 16 Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the party s core base shifted with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics 17 Since the 1990s the Party s support has chiefly come from the South the Great Plains the Mountain States and rural and exurban areas in the Midwest 18 19 The 21st century Republican Party ideology is American conservatism The GOP supports lower taxes free market capitalism a strong national defense gun rights pro life deregulation and restrictions on labor unions In addition to advocating for conservative economic policies the Republican Party is socially conservative After the Supreme Court s 1973 decision in Roe v Wade the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals 20 The GOP was strongly committed to protectionism and tariffs at its founding but grew more supportive of free trade in the 20th century There have been 19 Republican presidents the most from any one political party including current president Donald Trump who was elected in 2016 As of 2019 the GOP controls the presidency a majority in the U S Senate a majority of state governorships a majority 30 of state legislatures and 22 state government trifectas governorship and both legislative chambers Five of the nine sitting U S Supreme Court justices were nominated by Republican presidents Founded in the Northern states in 1854 by abolitionists ex Whigs and ex Free Soilers the Republican Party quickly became the principal opposition to the dominant Democratic Party and the briefly popular Know Nothing Party The party grew out of opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to slavery and future admission as slave states 21 22 The Republicans called for economic and social modernization They denounced the expansion of slavery as a great evil but did not call for ending it in the Southern states The first public meeting of the general anti Nebraska movement at which the name Republican was proposed was held on March 20 1854 in Ripon Wisconsin 23 The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson s Republican Party 24 The first official party convention was held on July 6 1854 in Jackson Michigan 25 At the 1856 Republican National Convention the party adopted a national platform emphasizing opposition to the expansion of slavery into U S territories 26 While Republican candidate John C Frémont lost the 1856 United States presidential election to James Buchanan he did win 11 of the 16 northern states 27 The Republican Party first came to power in the elections of 1860 when it won control of both houses of Congress and its candidate former congressman Abraham Lincoln was elected President In the election of 1864 it united with War Democrats to nominate Lincoln on the National Union Party ticket 27 Lincoln won re election 28 Under Republican congressional leadership the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which banned slavery in the United States passed the Senate in 1864 and the House in 1865 it was ratified in December 1865 29 The party s success created factionalism within the party in the 1870s Those who believed that Reconstruction had been accomplished and was continued mostly to promote the large scale corruption tolerated by President Ulysses S Grant ran Horace Greeley for the presidency in 1872 on the Liberal Republican Party line The Stalwart faction defended Grant and the spoils system whereas the Half Breeds pushed for reform of the civil service 30 The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was passed in 1883 31 the bill was signed into law by Republican President Chester A Arthur 32 The Republican Party supported hard money i e the gold standard high tariffs to promote economic growth high wages and high profits generous pensions for Union veterans and after 1893 the annexation of Hawaii The Republicans had strong support from pietistic Protestants but they resisted demands for Prohibition As the Northern postwar economy boomed with heavy and light industry railroads mines fast growing cities and prosperous agriculture the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to sustain the fast growth citation needed The GOP was usually dominant over the Democrats during the Third Party System 1850s 1890s However by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Interstate Commerce Commission in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers The high McKinley Tariff of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off year elections even defeating McKinley himself The Democrats elected Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892 The election of William McKinley in 1896 was marked by a resurgence of Republican dominance that lasted except for 1912 and 1916 until 1932 McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the Panic of 1893 and that Republicans would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit 33 The Republican Civil War era program included free homestead farms a federally subsidized transcontinental railroad a national banking system a large national debt land grants for higher education a new national banking system a wartime income tax and permanent high tariffs to promote industrial growth and high wages By the 1870s they had adopted as well a hard money system based on the gold standard and fought off efforts to promote inflation through Free Silver 34 They created the foundations of the modern welfare state through an extensive program of pensions for Union veterans 35 Foreign policy issues were rarely a matter of partisan dispute but briefly in the 1893 1904 period the GOP supported imperialistic expansion regarding Hawaii the Philippines and the Panama Canal 36 The 1896 realignment cemented the Republicans as the party of big business while Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by his embrace of trust busting He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in 1908 but they became enemies as the party split down the middle Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination and Roosevelt ran on the ticket of his new Progressive Bull Moose Party He called for social reforms many of which were later championed by New Deal Democrats in the 1930s He lost and when most of his supporters returned to the GOP they found they did not agree with the new conservative economic thinking leading to an ideological shift to the right in the Republican Party 37 The Republicans returned to the White House throughout the 1920s running on platforms of normalcy business oriented efficiency and high tariffs The national party platform avoided mention of prohibition instead issuing a vague commitment to law and order 38 Warren G Harding Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover were resoundingly elected in 1920 1924 and 1928 respectively The Teapot Dome scandal threatened to hurt the party but Harding died and the opposition splintered in 1924 The pro business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 heralded the Great Depression 39 The New Deal coalition of Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades excepting the two term presidency of Republican Dwight D Eisenhower Blacks moved into the Democratic Party during the New Deal era After Roosevelt took office in 1933 New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933 However long term unemployment remained a drag until 1940 In the 1934 midterm elections 10 Republican senators went down to defeat leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities citation needed The Republican Party split into a majority Old Right based in the Midwest and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal The Old Right sharply attacked the Second New Deal and said it represented class warfare and socialism Roosevelt was re elected in a landslide in 1936 however as his second term began the economy declined strikes soared and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party Republicans made a major comeback in the 1938 elections and had new rising stars such as Robert A Taft of Ohio on the right and Thomas E Dewey of New York on the left 40 Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the conservative coalition which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964 Both parties split on foreign policy issues with the anti war isolationists dominant in the Republican Party and the interventionists who wanted to stop Adolf Hitler dominant in the Democratic Party Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944 respectively Conservatives abolished most of the New Deal during the war but they did not attempt to reverse Social Security or the agencies that regulated business citation needed Historian George H Nash argues Unlike the moderate internationalist largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted or at least acquiesced in some of the Roosevelt Revolution and the essential premises of President Truman s foreign policy the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary Anti collectivist anti Communist anti New Deal passionately committed to limited government free market economics and congressional as opposed to executive prerogatives the G O P conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two front war against liberal Democrats from without and me too Republicans from within 41 The Democrats elected majorities to Congress almost continuously after 1932 the GOP won only in 1946 and 1952 but the conservative coalition blocked practically all major liberal proposals in domestic policy clarification needed After 1945 the internationalist wing of the GOP cooperated with Harry S Truman s Cold War foreign policy funded the Marshall Plan and supported NATO despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right 42 The second half of the 20th century saw the election or succession of Republican presidents Dwight D Eisenhower Richard Nixon Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush Eisenhower had defeated conservative leader Senator Robert A Taft for the 1952 nomination but conservatives dominated the domestic policies of the Eisenhower administration Voters liked Eisenhower much more than they liked the GOP and he proved unable to shift the party to a more moderate position Since 1976 liberalism has virtually faded out of the Republican Party apart from a few Northeastern holdouts 43 Since he left office in 1989 Reagan has been an iconic conservative Republican and Republican presidential candidates frequently claim to share his views and aim to establish themselves and their policies as the more appropriate heir to his legacy 44 In the Republican Revolution of 1994 the party led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich who campaigned on the Contract with America won majorities in both Houses of Congress However as House Speaker Gingrich was unable to deliver on many of its promises including a balanced budget amendment and term limits for members of Congress During the impeachment and acquittal of President Bill Clinton Republicans suffered surprise losses in the 1998 midterm elections Gingrich s popularity sank to 17 he resigned the speakership and later resigned from Congress altogether 45 46 47 The Republican Senate majority lasted until 2001 when the Senate became split evenly but it was regained in the 2002 elections Both Republican majorities in the House and Senate were held until the Democrats regained control in the mid term elections of 2006 The Republican Party has since been defined by social conservatism a preemptive war foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy a more powerful executive branch supply side economics deregulation and support for the Second Amendment citation needed A George W Bush Dick Cheney ticket won the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections In the presidential election of 2008 the John McCain Sarah Palin ticket was defeated by Senators Barack Obama and Joe Biden The Republicans experienced electoral success in the wave election of 2010 which coincided with the ascendancy of the Tea Party movement 48 49 50 51 That success began with the upset win of Scott Brown in the Massachusetts special Senate election for a seat that had been held for decades by the Democratic Kennedy brothers In the November elections Republicans recaptured control of the House increased their number of seats in the Senate and gained a majority of governorships 52 Obama and Biden won re election in 2012 defeating a Mitt Romney Paul Ryan ticket The campaign focused largely on the Affordable Care Act and President Obama s stewardship of the economy as the country still faced high unemployment numbers and a rising national debt stemming from the Great Recession While Republicans lost seven seats in the House in the November congressional elections they still retained control However Republicans were not able to gain control of the Senate continuing their minority status with a net loss of two seats citation needed In the aftermath of the loss some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party 53 54 55 A post 2012 post mortem report by the Republican Party concluded that the party needed to do more on the national level to attract votes from minorities and young voters 56 After the 2014 midterm elections the Republican Party took control of the Senate by gaining nine seats 57 With a final total of 247 seats 57 in the House and 54 seats in the Senate the Republicans ultimately achieved their largest majority in the Congress since the 71st Congress in 1929 58 After the 2016 elections Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate House Governorships and elected Donald Trump as President The Republican Party controlled 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017 the most it had held in history 59 and at least 33 governorships the most it had held since 1922 60 The party had total control of government legislative chambers and governorship in 25 states 61 62 the most since 1952 63 the opposing Democratic Party had full control in only five states 64 As of 2019 there have been a total of 19 Republican Presidents the most from any one party in American history Republicans have won 24 of the last 40 presidential elections 65 Following the results of the 2018 midterm elections the Republican Party controls the bulk of the power in the United States as of 2019 holding the presidency Donald Trump a majority in the United States Senate and a majority of governorships 27 and state legislatures full control of 30 50 legislatures split control of two 66 As of 2019 the GOP holds a trifecta control of the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch in a plurality of states 22 of 50 67 Five of the nine current justices of the Supreme Court were appointed by Republican presidents 68 For most of the post World War II era Republicans had little presence at the state legislative level This trend began to reverse in the late 1990s with Republicans increasing their state legislative presence and taking control of state legislatures in the South From 2004 to 2014 the Republican State Leadership Committee RSLC raised over 140 million targeted to state legislature races while the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee DLSC raised less than half that during that time period Following the 2014 midterm elections Republicans controlled 68 of 98 partisan state legislative houses the most in the party s history and controlled both the executive and legislative branches of government in 24 states Democrats had control of only seven 69 With the inauguration of Republican George W Bush as President the Republican Party remained fairly cohesive for much of the 2000s as both strong economic libertarians and social conservatives opposed the Democrats whom they saw as the party of bloated secular and liberal government 70 The Bush era rise of what were known as pro government conservatives a core part of the President s base meant that a considerable group of the Republicans advocated for increased government spending and greater regulations covering both the economy and people s personal lives as well as for an activist interventionist foreign policy citation needed Survey groups such as the Pew Research Center found that social conservatives and free market advocates remained the other two main groups within the party s coalition of support with all three being roughly equal in number 71 72 However libertarians and libertarian leaning conservatives increasingly found fault with what they saw as Republicans restricting of vital civil liberties while corporate welfare and the national debt hiked considerably under Bush s tenure 73 In contrast some social conservatives expressed dissatisfaction with the party s support for economic policies that conflicted with their moral values 74 In March 2013 National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave a stinging report on the party s electoral failures in 2012 calling on Republicans to reinvent themselves and officially endorse immigration reform He said There s no one reason we lost Our message was weak our ground game was insufficient we weren t inclusive we were behind in both data and digital and our primary and debate process needed improvement He proposed 219 reforms that included a 10 million marketing campaign to reach women minorities and gays as well as setting a shorter more controlled primary season and creating better data collection facilities 75 A March 2013 poll found that a majority of Republicans and Republican leaning independents under the age of 49 supported legal recognition of same sex marriages Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remarked that the p arty is going to be torn on this issue 76 77 A Reuters Ipsos survey from April 2015 found that 68 of Americans overall would attend the same sex wedding of a loved one with 56 of Republicans agreeing Reuters journalist Jeff Mason remarked that Republicans who stake out strong opposition to gay marriage could be on shaky political ground if their ultimate goal is to win the White House given the divide between the social conservative stalwarts and the rest of the United States that opposes them 78 In 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled bans on same sex marriage to be unconstitutional thus legalizing same sex marriage nationwide 79 In 2016 after being elected President Republican Donald Trump stated that he was fine with same sex marriage 80 The party s founding members chose the name Republican Party in the mid 1850s as homage to the values of republicanism promoted by Thomas Jefferson s Republican Party 82 The idea for the name came from an editorial by the party s leading publicist Horace Greeley who called for some simple name like Republican that would more fitly designate those who had united to restore the Union to its true mission of champion and promulgator of Liberty rather than propagandist of slavery 83 The name reflects the 1776 republican values of civic virtue and opposition to aristocracy and corruption 84 It is important to note that republican has a variety of meanings around the world and the Republican Party has evolved such that the meanings no longer always align 85 86 The term Grand Old Party is a traditional nickname for the Republican Party and the abbreviation GOP is a commonly used designation The term originated in 1875 in the Congressional Record referring to the party associated with the successful military defense of the Union as this gallant old party The following year in an article in the Cincinnati Commercial the term was modified to grand old party The first use of the abbreviation is dated 1884 87 The traditional mascot of the party is the elephant A political cartoon by Thomas Nast published in Harper s Weekly on November 7 1874 is considered the first important use of the symbol 88 An alternate symbol of the Republican Party in states such as Indiana New York and Ohio is the bald eagle as opposed to the Democratic rooster or the Democratic five pointed star 89 90 In Kentucky the log cabin is a symbol of the Republican Party not related to the gay Log Cabin Republicans organization 91 Traditionally the party had no consistent color identity 92 93 94 After the 2000 election the color red became associated with Republicans During and after the election the major broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map states won by Republican nominee George W Bush were colored red and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue Due to the weeks long dispute over the election results these color associations became firmly ingrained persisting in subsequent years Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal the media has come to represent the respective political parties using these colors The party and its candidates have also come to embrace the color red 95 Republicans believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity Republicans frequently advocate in favor of fiscal conservatism during Democratic administrations however they have shown themselves willing to increase federal debt when they are in charge of the government the implementation of the Bush tax cuts Medicare Part D and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are examples of this willingness 96 97 98 Despite pledges to roll back government spending Republican administrations have since the late 1960s sustained previous levels of government spending 99 Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply side economics which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth 100 Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and tax collection 101 Republicans believe individuals should take responsibility for their own circumstances They also believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor through charity than the government is through welfare programs and that social assistance programs often cause government dependency citation needed Republicans believe corporations should be able to establish their own employment practices including benefits and wages with the free market deciding the price of work Since the 1920s Republicans have generally been opposed by labor union organizations and members At the national level Republicans supported the Taft Hartley Act of 1947 which gives workers the right not to participate in unions Modern Republicans at the state level generally support various right to work laws which prohibit union security agreements requiring all workers in a unionized workplace to pay dues or a fair share fee regardless of if they are members of the union or not 102 Most Republicans tend to oppose increases in the minimum wage believing that such increases hurt businesses by forcing them to cut and outsource jobs and pass costs along to consumers citation needed The party opposes a single payer health care system describing it as socialized medicine The Republican Party has a mixed record of supporting the historically popular Social Security Medicare and Medicaid programs 103 Historically progressive leaders in the Republican Party supported environmental protection Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the National Park Service 104 While Republican President Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program 105 However this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy 106 Since then Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation with some Republicans rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change 106 107 108 109 In 2006 then California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger broke from Republican orthodoxy to sign several bills imposing caps on carbon emissions in California Then President George W Bush opposed mandatory caps at a national level Bush s decision not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant was challenged in the Supreme Court by 12 states 110 with the court ruling against the Bush administration in 2007 111 Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols 106 112 which sought to limit greenhouse gas emissions and thereby combat climate change his position was heavily criticized by climate scientists 113 The Republican Party rejects cap and trade policy to limit carbon emissions 114 In the 2000s Senator John McCain proposed bills such as the McCain Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act that would have regulated carbon emissions but his position on climate change was unusual among high ranking party members 106 Some Republican candidates have supported the development of alternative fuels in order to achieve energy independence for the United States Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a position that has drawn criticism from activists 115 Many Republicans during the presidency of Barack Obama opposed his administration s new environmental regulations such as those on carbon emissions from coal In particular many Republicans supported building the Keystone Pipeline this position was supported by businesses but opposed by indigenous peoples groups and environmental activists 116 117 118 According to the Center for American Progress a non profit liberal advocacy group more than 55 of congressional Republicans were climate change deniers 119 120 PolitiFact in May 2014 found relatively few Republican members of Congress accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man made The group found eight members who acknowledged it although the group acknowledged there could be more and that not all members of Congress have taken a stance on the issue 121 122 From 2008 to 2017 the Republican Party went from debating how to combat human caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist according to The New York Times 123 In January 2015 the Republican led U S Senate voted 98 1 to pass a resolution acknowledging that climate change is real and is not a hoax however an amendment stating that human activity significantly contributes to climate change was supported by only five Republican senators 124 In the period 1850 1870 the Republican Party was more opposed to immigration than Democrats in part because the Republican Party relied on the support of anti Catholic and anti immigrant parties such as the Know Nothings at the time In the decades following the Civil War the Republican Party grew more supportive of immigration as it represented manufacturers in the Northeast who wanted additional labor whereas the Democratic Party came to be seen as the party of labor which wanted fewer laborers to compete with Starting in the 1970s the parties switched places again as the Democrats grew more supportive of immigration than Republicans 125 Republicans are divided on how to confront illegal immigration between a platform that allows for migrant workers and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants supported by establishment types versus a position focused on securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants supported by populists In 2006 the White House supported and Republican led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens but the House also led by Republicans did not advance the bill 126 After the defeat in the 2012 presidential election particularly among Latinos several Republicans advocated a friendlier approach to immigrants However in 2016 the field of candidates took a sharp position against illegal immigration with leading candidate Donald Trump proposing building a wall along the southern border Proposals calling for immigration reform with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants have attracted broad Republican support in some which polls In a 2013 poll 60 of Republicans supported the pathway concept 127 Some who in the Republican Party support unilateralism on issues of national security believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense In general Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders The realist school s influence shows in Reagan s Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W Bush s Axis of evil stance citation needed Since the September 11 2001 attacks many who in the party have supported neoconservative policies with regard to the War on Terror including the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq The George W Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants while other which prominent Republicans strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques which they view as torture 128 Republicans have frequently advocated for restricting foreign aid as a means of asserting the national security and immigration interests of the United States 129 130 131 The Republican Party generally supports a strong alliance with Israel and efforts to secure peace in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab neighbors 132 133 In recent years Republicans have begun to move away from the two state solution approach to resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict 134 135 In a 2014 poll 59 of Republicans favored doing less abroad and focusing on the country s own problems instead 136 According to the 2016 platform 137 the party s stance on the status of Taiwan is We oppose any unilateral steps by either side to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Straits on the principle that all issues regarding the island s future must be resolved peacefully through dialogue and be agreeable to the people of Taiwan In addition if China were to violate those principles the United States in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act will help Taiwan defend itself The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions The social conservatives want laws that uphold their traditional values such as opposition to same sex marriage abortion and marijuana 138 Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control affirmative action and illegal immigration 138 139 A majority of the party s national and state candidates are pro life and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds While many advocate exceptions in the case of incest rape or the mother s life being at risk in 2012 the party approved a platform advocating banning abortions without exception 140 There were not highly polarized differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party prior to the Roe v Wade 1973 Supreme Court ruling which made prohibitions on abortion rights unconstitutional but after the Supreme Court ruling opposition to abortion became an increasingly key national platform for the Republican Party 20 141 142 As a result Evangelicals gravitated towards the Republican Party 20 141 Most Republicans oppose government and tax payer funding for abortion providers notably Planned Parenthood 143 Until its dissolution in 2018 Republican Majority for Choice a pro choice PAC advocated for amending the GOP platform to include pro choice members 144 Although Republicans have voted for increases in government funding of scientific research members of the Republican Party actively oppose the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human embryos 145 146 147 148 Republicans are generally against affirmative action for women and some minorities often describing it as a quota system and believing that it is not meritocratic and that it is counter productive socially by only further promoting discrimination Many who Republicans support race neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student 149 150 Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns Republicans have historically supported the War on Drugs and oppose the legalization of drugs 151 More recently several which prominent Republicans have advocated for the reduction and reform of mandatory sentencing laws with regards to drugs 152 Owing largely to the prominence of the religious right in conservative politics in the United States the Republican Party had traditionally taken positions regarded as somewhat unwelcoming to the gay rights movement However President Donald Trump has expressed support for the LGBT community 153 and the Republican party membership has begun shifting their views to express more support for same sex marriage 154 Republicans have historically opposed same sex marriage while being divided on civil unions and domestic partnerships with the issue being one that many believe helped George W Bush win re election in 2004 155 In both 2004 156 and 2006 157 President Bush Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House Majority Leader John Boehner promoted the Federal Marriage Amendment a proposed constitutional amendment which would legally restrict the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples 158 159 160 In both attempts the amendment failed to secure enough votes to invoke cloture and thus ultimately was never passed As more states legalized same sex marriage in the 2010s Republicans increasingly supported allowing each state to decide its own marriage policy 161 As of 2014 most state GOP platforms expressed opposition to same sex marriage 162 The 2016 GOP Platform included language supporting traditional marriage and condemning the Supreme Court s ruling legalizing same sex marriages 163 However public opinion on this issue within the party has been changing 164 Following his election as President of the United States in 2016 President elect Donald Trump stated that he had no objection to same sex marriage or to the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v Hodges 80 As President Donald Trump was the first sitting Republican president to recognize LGBT Pride Month 165 The Republican Party platform had opposed the inclusion of gay people in the military had opposed adding sexual orientation to the list of protected classes since 1992 166 167 168 The Republican Party opposed the inclusion of sexual preference in anti discrimination statutes from 1992 to 2004 169 The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported anti discrimination statutes based on sex race age religion creed disability or national origin but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity 170 171 A group of LGBT Republicans is the Log Cabin Republicans 172 Virtually all restrictions on voting have in recent years been implemented by Republicans Republicans mainly at the state level argue that the restrictions such as purging voter rolls limiting voting locations and prosecuting double voting are vital to prevent voter fraud claiming that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections However research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party s favor Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of establishing them with partisan purpose 173 174 Towards the end of the 1990s and in the early 21st century the Republican Party increasingly resorted to constitutional hardball practices 175 176 177 A number of scholars have asserted that the House speakership of Republican Newt Gingrich played a key role in undermining democratic norms in the United States hastening political polarization and increasing partisan prejudice 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 According to Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky Gingrich s speakership had a profound and lasting impact on American politics and health of American democracy They argue that Gingrich instilled a combative approach in the Republican Party where hateful language and hyper partisanship became commonplace and where democratic norms were abandoned Gingrich frequently questioned the patriotism of Democrats called them corrupt compared them to fascists and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States Gingrich was also involved in several major government shutdowns 182 189 190 191 Scholars have also characterized Mitch McConnell s tenure as Senate Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader during the Obama presidency as one where obstructionism reached all time highs 192 Political scientists have referred to McConnell s use of the filibuster as constitutional hardball referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy 175 182 183 187 McConnell delayed and obstructed health care reform and banking reform which were two landmark pieces of legislation that Democrats sought to pass and in fact did pass 193 early in Obama s tenure 194 195 By delaying Democratic priority legislation McConnell stymied the output of Congress Political scientists Eric Schickler and Gregory J Wawro write by slowing action even on measures supported by many Republicans McConnell capitalized on the scarcity of floor time forcing Democratic leaders into difficult trade offs concerning which measures were worth pursuing That is given that Democrats had just two years with sizeable majorities to enact as much of their agenda as possible slowing the Senate s ability to process even routine measures limited the sheer volume of liberal bills that could be adopted 195 McConnell s refusal to hold hearings on Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland during the final year of Obama s presidency was described by political scientists and legal scholars as unprecedented 196 197 a culmination of this confrontational style 198 a blatant abuse of constitutional norms 199 and a classic example of constitutional hardball 187 Senate Republicans justified this move by pointing to a 1992 speech from then Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Joe Biden 200 201 in that speech Biden argued that hearings on any potential Supreme Court nominee that year should be postponed until after Election Day 200 202 Biden

establishment wings 223 224 Nationwide polls of Republican voters in 2014 by the Pew Center identified a growing split in the Republican coalition between business conservatives or establishment conservatives on one side and steadfast conservatives or populist conservatives on the other 225 In the 21st century conservatives on talk radio and Fox News as well as such outlets as the Drudge

them employment opportunities They became one of the core components of the New Deal coalition In the South after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a

the eligible voters of its core base of older less educated men 254 255 256 257 Religion has always played a major role for both parties but in the course of a century the parties religious compositions have changed Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960 with Catholics Jews and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 1980s that undercut the New Deal coalition 258 Voters who attend church weekly gave 61 of their votes to Bush in 2004 and those who attend occasionally gave him only 47 while those who never attend gave him 36 Fifty nine percent of Protestants voted for Bush along with 52 of Catholics even though John Kerry

stay in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church on subjects such as abortion euthanasia embryonic stem cell research and same sex marriage they differ on the death penalty and contraception 261 Pope Francis 2015 encyclical Laudato si sparked a discussion on the positions of Catholic Republicans in relation to the positions of the Church The Pope s encyclical on behalf of the Catholic Church officially acknowledges a man made climate change caused by burning fossil fuels 262 The Pope says the warming of the planet is rooted in a throwaway culture and the developed world s indifference to the destruction of the planet in pursuit of short term economic gains According to The New York Times Laudato si put pressure on the Catholic candidates in the 2016 election Jeb Bush Bobby Jindal Marco Rubio and Rick Santorum 263 With leading Democrats praising the encyclical James Bretzke a professor of moral theology at Boston College has said that both sides were being disingenuous I think it shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats like to use religious authority and in this case the Pope to support positions they have arrived at independently There is a certain insincerity a hypocrisy I think on both sides 264 While a Pew Research poll indicates Catholics are more likely to believe the Earth is warming than non Catholics 51 of Catholic Republicans believe in global warming less than the general population and only 24 of Catholic Republicans believe global warming is caused by human activity 265 As of 2018 there have been a total of 19 Republican presidents

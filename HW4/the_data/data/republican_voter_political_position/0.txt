The platform of the Republican Party of the United States is generally based on conservatism 1 2 3 in contrast to the modern liberalism of the Democrats The party incorporates moderates sometimes described as establishment Republicans and members of the Tea Party or Freedom Caucus who have been described as populist right wing and far right 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 The Republican Party s conservatism involves support for free market capitalism free enterprise business a strong national defense deregulation restrictions on labor unions social conservative policies and traditional values usually with a Christian foundation 12 The party is generally split on the issue of how to deal with illegal immigration 13 In general Republicans oppose abortion rights funding to Planned Parenthood drugs the Affordable Care Act Common Core gun control and support Just Say No and school choice On economics Republicans oppose an increased minimum wage and the estate tax and support free markets and individual achievement On the environment Republicans have introduced environmental programs such as the Environmental Protection Agency and cap and trade policies in the past but tend to oppose them today 14 Republicans support clean air and clean water policies but also support increased fracking Republicans are quite divided on some environmental topics such as climate change where a 2018 poll found that 64 of Republicans believed in climate change 15 Only 44 of Republicans and Republican leaners support same sex marriage 16 That being said it is notable that Republicans like Democrats tend to vote in favor of policies endorsed by party leaders irrespective of ideology 17 Republican party leaders strongly believe that free markets and individual achievement are the primary factors behind economic prosperity To this end they advocate in favor of laissez faire economics fiscal conservatism and eliminating government run welfare programs in favor of private sector nonprofits and encouraging personal responsibility Republican voters however do not hold these views as consistently as their party s leaders 18 A leading economic theory advocated by modern Republicans is supply side economics Some fiscal policies influenced by this theory were popularly known as Reaganomics a term popularized during the Ronald Reagan administration This theory holds that reduced income tax rates increase GDP growth and thereby generate the same or more revenue for the government from the smaller tax on the extra growth 19 This belief is reflected in part by the party s long term advocacy of tax cuts Many Republicans consider the income tax system to be inherently inefficient and oppose graduated tax rates which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth They also believe private spending is usually more efficient than government spending Republicans generally oppose the estate tax Between the 19th century and the early 20th century Republicans favored tariffs to protect and encourage American industry and industrial workers In 1896 the GOP platform pledged to renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection as the bulwark of American industrial independence and the foundation of development and prosperity This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods it secures the American market for the American producer It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman Most Republicans agree there should be a safety net to assist the less fortunate citation needed however they tend to believe the private sector is more effective in helping the poor than government is as a result Republicans support giving government grants to private charitable organizations including faith based organizations to supplant welfare spending Republicans also believe that limits on eligibility and benefits must be in place to ensure that the safety net is not abused Republicans introduced and strongly supported the welfare reform of 1996 which was signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton and limited eligibility for welfare successfully allowing many former welfare recipients to find jobs 20 21 The party opposes a government run single payer health care system claiming it constitutes socialized medicine and is in favor of a personal or employer based system of insurance supplemented by Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid which covers approximately 40 of the poor citation needed dead link 22 Republicans have a mixed record of supporting Social Security Medicare and Medicaid citation needed Congressional Republicans and the Bush administration supported to reduce Medicaid s growth rate 23 however congressional Republicans expanded Medicare supporting a new drug plan for seniors starting in 2006 In 2011 Republicans in the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted for a proposal known as The Path to Prosperity and for major changes to Medicare Medicaid and the 2010 health care legislation Many Republicans support increased health insurance portability laws promoting coverage of pre existing medical conditions a cap on malpractice lawsuits implementing a streamlined electronic medical records system an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care and tax benefits aimed to make health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and to promote universal access citation needed They generally oppose government funding for elective abortions 24 Since the 1920s Republicans have generally been opposed to labor unions which comprise a major component of the Democratic New Deal coalition Although unions have lost membership in the private sector since the 1970s they have gained among public sector unions such as school teachers Republicans at the state level generally support various right to work laws that weaken unions At the national level Republicans supported the Taft Hartley Act of 1947 one of the most immensely anti communist acts which gives workers the right not to participate in unions as opposed to a closed shop which prohibits workers from choosing not to join unions in workplaces Most Republicans are opposed to increases in the minimum wage believing that such increases hurt many businesses by forcing them to cut jobs and services export jobs overseas and raise the prices of goods to compensate for the decrease in profit As Taylor Dark has emphasized in his analysis of the enduring alliance between labor unions and the Democrats the unions most virulent opponents have moved into the Republican Party 25 Republicans elected with Tea Party support in 2010 most notably Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin have launched major efforts against public sector unions due in part to state government pension obligations along with the allegation that the unions are too powerful 26 Walker was challenged by a coalition of unions and Democrats but beat back a recall effort and was reelected in 2014 27 Many contemporary Republicans voice support of strict constructionism or textualism the judicial philosophy that the Constitution should be interpreted narrowly and as close to the original intent as is practicable rather than a more flexible living Constitution model 28 Most Republicans point to Roe v Wade as a case of judicial activism where the court overturned most laws restricting abortion on the basis of a right to privacy inferred from the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Some Republicans have actively sought to block judges whom they see as being activist judges and have sought the appointment of judges who claim to practice judicial restraint The issue of judicial deference to the legislature is a matter of some debate like the Democrats most Republicans criticize court decisions that overturn their own conservative legislation as overstepping bounds and support decisions that overturn opposing legislation Some commentators have advocated that the Republicans take a more aggressive approach and support legislative supremacy more firmly 29 The Republican Party has supported various bills within the last decade to strip some or all federal courts of the ability to hear certain types of cases in an attempt to strengthen the power of individual state s rights These jurisdiction stripping laws have included removing federal review of the recognition of same sex marriage with the Marriage Protection Act 30 the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance with the Pledge Protection Act and the rights of detainees in Guantanamo Bay in the Detainee Treatment Act The Supreme Court overruled the last of these limitations in Hamdan v Rumsfeld Compared to Democrats many Republicans believe in a more robust version of federalism with greater limitations placed upon federal authorities and a larger role reserved for those of the individual States Following this view on federalism Republicans often take a less expansive reading of congressional power under the Commerce Clause such as in the opinion of William Rehnquist in United States v Lopez Many Republicans on the more libertarian wing wish for a more dramatic narrowing of Commerce Clause power by revisiting among other cases Wickard v Filburn a case that held that growing wheat on a farm for consumption on the same farm fell under congressional power to regulate commerce among the several States President George W Bush was a proponent of the unitary executive theory and cited it within his Signing statements about legislation passed by Congress 31 The administration s interpretation of the unitary executive theory was called seriously into question by Hamdan v Rumsfeld where the Supreme Court ruled 5 3 that the President does not have sweeping powers to override or ignore laws through his power as commander in chief 32 stating the Executive is bound to comply with the Rule of Law that prevails 33 Following the ruling the Bush administration sought Congressional authorization for programs started only on executive mandate as was the case with the Military Commissions Act or abandoned programs it had previously asserted executive authority to enact as in the case of the National Security Agency domestic wiretapping program Ideologically the GOP typically supports a smaller federal government Historically this translated into keeping power in the hands of powerful state governments as in the cases of civil rights abortion laws regulations on marriage and mapping of voting districts 34 page needed However some conservatives in recent years have demanded federal intervention to oppose state laws with respect to the Federal Marriage Amendment the Terri Schiavo case the Kelo case regarding eminent domain and in cases involving assisted suicide laws and medical marijuana citation needed To a certain extent this is contingent upon the faction in question For example the paleoconservative and social conservative factions would be far more inclined to favor federal drug regulations trumping states rights while the libertarian faction would be more inclined to see such power devolved to the states or even further citation needed Historically more progressive leaders in the Republican party supported environmental protection For example Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern National Park Service 35 Republican President Richard Nixon was responsible for establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 36 37 In 2006 Arnold Schwarzenegger then the Republican Governor of California signed into law a set of carbon emission regulations that were the country s first cap on greenhouse gases and included vehicle emissions standards higher than those of the Federal Government These regulations were opposed by the Bush administration 38 President George W Bush publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring major polluters such as China and India 39 In 2000 the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market based solutions to environmental problems According to the platform economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together environmental regulations should be based on science the government s role should be to provide market based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes 40 The Bush administration 41 along with several of the candidates that sought the Republican Presidential nomination in 2008 42 43 44 supported increased Federal investment into the development of clean alternative fuels increased nuclear power as well as fuels such as ethanol as a way of helping the U S achieve energy independence as opposed to supporting less use of carbon dioxide producing methods of generating energy The Republican party rejects cap and trade policy 45 Some Republicans support increased oil drilling in protected areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 46 a position that has drawn sharp criticism from some activists Republicans are deeply divided over the human causes of climate change and global warming 47 Since 2008 48 many members of the Republican Party have been criticized for being anti environmentalist 49 50 51 and promoting climate change denial 52 53 54 in opposition to the general scientific consensus making them unique even among other worldwide conservative parties 54 Green conservatism manifested itself as a movement in groups such as ConservAmerica which seeks to strengthen the Republican Party s stance on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural resources and protect human and environmental health 55 The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions The social conservatives want laws that uphold their traditional values such as opposition to same sex marriage abortion and marijuana 56 Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control affirmative action and illegal immigration 56 57 A majority of the party s national and state candidates are at the very least moderately pro life and oppose elective abortion on religious or moral grounds However many hold exceptions in the case of incest rape or the mother s life being at risk while others may accept early stage abortions firmly opposing partial birth abortion still When Congress voted on the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 Congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to support the ban Although Republicans have voted for increases in government funding of scientific research some members actively oppose the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of human embryos while arguing for applying research money into adult stem cell or amniotic stem cell research 58 59 60 The stem cell issue has garnered two vetoes on research funding bills from President Bush who said the research crossed a moral boundary The text of the 2012 party platform specifically stated that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed It also opposed using public revenues to promote abortions to perform them or to fund organizations that do either such things 61 Not all Republicans support abortion restrictions and the human life amendment Though pro life planks have been part of the party platform since 1976 62 before 1988 there was little difference between Republicans and other voters regarding abortion and in 2015 40 percent of Republicans supported legal abortion 63 Despite their divergence from the party platform pro choice Republicans are unlikely to switch parties 64 Pro choice ideology has been present in the Republican Party since before the Roe v Wade decision in 1973 and the pro choice ideology is still present today According to some pro choice Republican groups the Republican belief in limited government and individualism should extend to social issues such as abortion rights 65 Research indicates that supporters of pro choice Republican organizations are motivated by libertarianism 66 Supporters of pro choice organizations may hold less conservative views on abortion but tend to hold relatively conservative views on other political issues 67 Pro choice ideology and support for abortion rights ranges The 1992 American National Election study asked respondents about their support for the legal rights of abortion Respondents either believe abortion should only be allowed in cases of rape incest and to save the mother s life abortion should be allowed if there is a clear need or that abortion should not be restricted in any way 68 There are several organizations and Political Action Committees that support pro choice republican candidates The most prominent are Republican Majority for Choice Republicans for Choice and The Wish List These organizations provide money endorsements and training to candidates who support abortion rights Republican Main Street Partnership has shown support for pro choice legislation The Republican Party s shift to a pro life stance was a gradual change and was not caused by one election or event 69 Early abortion laws only allowed the procedure when the woman s life was in danger At this time many Republicans and Democrats as well were for less strict abortion laws 70 Between 1974 and 1978 studies showed that political ideology had a very weak correlation with support for abortion rights The correlation between political party identification and support for abortion rights was even weaker 71 Mary Louise Smith the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee from 1974 to 1977 was pro choice 70 Justice Blackmun wrote the Supreme Courts decision on Roe v Wade Blackmun had been conservative Justice appointed by President Nixon who came out against abortion 70 After Roe vs Wade though Blackmun gradually evolved into a liberal Some say this issue was the symbolic move of Blackmun to becoming a liberal During his presidency President Gerald R Ford took a moderately conservative stance on abortion despite First Lady Betty Ford s urges for him to take a liberal stance on the issue Ford believed abortions should be allowed in certain circumstances such as rape and incest and opposed a human life amendment to the Constitution 70 After winning the primary Ford stated he was also unconditionally pro life and fully supported the Republican platform in 1976 Still Ford later stated that he was pro choice after he had left office 72 and Betty Ford was supportive of the decision made by the court in Roe v Wade 70 The 1976 Republican Party Platform was the first to include a pro life stance This comes during the same year that the Hyde Amendment Was passed 73 Ronald Reagan s run in the primary for the nomination played a role in getting an anti abortion plank along with some other positions on other issues into the platform Democrat and Republican Party elites and elected officials became more divided on the issue of abortion in the 1980s Still Ronald Reagan ran and won the election in 1980 stating he was against all abortions except for saving the life of the mother He firmly supported Roe Vs Wade being overturned and a constitutional amendment banning abortion Robert Dole who ran in the primary for president in 1980 also firmly opposed abortion George H W Bush who also ran in the primary was firmly pro choice Bush wound up being Reagan s vice presidential running mate and after that he distanced himself from that issue It was not until after Republicans in Congress started consistently voting against abortion in the 1980s that polls showed Republican opposition to abortion 74 Until 1988 there was little difference in pro choice attitudes among Democrat and Republican voters 75 Also George H W Bush shifted his position on abortion He stated after some reflection he came to the conclusion abortion was morally wrong and should only be legal for rape incest and to save the life of the mother He also chose Dan Quayle as his running mate who also opposed abortion Bush staed his position evolved while he was vice president While running Bush promised strict constructionist judges Like Reagan Ford and Nixon all promised who interpret not make laws This is considered code language for overturning Roe Vs Wade Bush did state though he would not use abortion as a litmus test for judges like Reagan did Though Bush did appoint one anti Roe judge as did Reagan and Nixon though Nixon s appointments were made prior to abortion becoming an issue During the 1992 election President Bush and Vice President Quayle tended to downplay the importance of abortion during the election so they would not risk turning away Republican voters who supported abortion rights 76 A substantial number of Pro choice republicans in the 1992 election did not vote for President Bush because of his stance on abortion Most of these pro choice Republicans voted for Perot 76 While President Bush and the Republican Party took a pro life stance in 1992 First Lady Barbara Bush stated that she believed abortion to be a personal choice 77 In an interview in 2001 First Lady Laura Bush stated that she believed Roe v Wade should not be overturned 78 and later stated that abortion should remain legal because she believes it s important for people for medical reasons and other reasons 79 George W Bush though stated he was still pro life and while he would be appointing conservative judges abortion would not be used as a litmus test In 2005 The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act was passed by congress with the help of the Republican Main Street Partnership However President George W Bush vetoed this legislation in 2006 80 After the 2012 election Senator John McCain who is pro life advised his fellow Republicans to leave the issue abortion alone He warned against going beyond stating one s pro life belief and actions could hurt the Republican party with women voters and young voters 81 Like Bush I II Dole Reagan and Ford McCain promised conservative constructionist judges but again stated he would not use abortion as a litmus test Mitt Romney as governor of Massachusetts was firmly pro choice but he became pro life running for president in 2012 and stated the same thing about conservative judges but not using abortion as a litmus test In 2016 though Donald Trump abruptly shifted his position on abortion For decades as a Democrat and independent he was firmly pro choice When he began running for president in 2015 he also was pro choice But as it seemed more apparent he would get the nomination he too shifted to a pro life stance By the summer Trump was also pro life Unlike the previous candidates Trump made a promise during his debate with Hillary to appoint pro life judges to the US Supreme Court as well as to lower courts He later had to take that statement back saying he was not even allowed to ask a judge what his personal position on abortion or any other issue was He still affirmed he would appoint judges that interpret the law not make law and on abortion they would hopefully see it as a constitutional issue turning the rulings over to the states and overturning Roe Trump did state he believed in exceptions of rape and incest as well as to saving the life of the mother on his anti abortion stance In a 2015 poll 6 out of 10 moderate Republicans believed that abortion should be legal in most or all instances Republicans especially Republican women are generally against affirmative action for women and some minorities often describing it as a quota system and believing that it is not meritocratic and that it is counter productive socially by only further promoting discrimination Many Republicans support race neutral admissions policies in universities but support taking into account the socioeconomic status of the student 82 83 Republicans generally support gun ownership rights and oppose laws regulating guns and other related topic areas such as bump stocks and large capacity magazines 84 However recently when some moderate Republicans have started to be an exception to this On the evening of Wednesday November 28 2018 President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be banning bump stocks 85 Some Republicans support this and some do not causing some divide within the party citation needed Republicans have historically supported the War on Drugs and oppose the drug legalization of any kind believing them to be immoral and wrong and that the country should do its best to protect people from illegal drugs and support Just Say No citation needed More recently several prominent Republicans have advocated for the reduction and reform of mandatory sentencing laws with regards to drugs 86 Most Republicans support school choice through charter schools and school vouchers for private schools many have denounced the performance of the public school system and the teachers unions The party has insisted on a system of greater accountability for public schools most prominently in recent years with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 Many Republicans however opposed the creation of the United States Department of Education when it was initially created in 1979 87 Republicans tend to oppose No Child Left Behind and the Common Core State Standards Republicans have traditionally opposed same sex marriage and other LGBT rights citation needed Groups advocating for LGBT issues inside the party include the Log Cabin Republicans Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry and College Republicans In the aftermath of the U S Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v Hodges that ended bans on same sex marriage nationwide the Republican Party is divided as to whether to accept the ruling or to fight it by measures such as a possible amendment to the Constitution Individuals such as 2016 Presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Scott Walker have supported an amendment to re expand government and re ban same sex marriages while other Republican figures such as Jeb Bush also a 2016 Presidential candidate have disagreed 88 A November December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that Republicans are divided in their perceptions of their own party 45 think Republicans are friendly toward LGBT people while 41 think the party is unfriendly toward them 89 The 1992 Republican presidential platform was the first to oppose same sex marriage 90 A May 2012 poll found that 37 of Republicans supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage between a man and a woman 92 A November December 2013 poll found that 63 of Republicans believe same sex marriage should be left up to individual states to decide 89 Republicans in general tend to be more pro military than their Democrat counterparts 93 however the factions of the Republican party do not see eye to eye on this Neoconservative Republicans and subscribers to other such ideologies tend to advocate for more interventionist foreign policies a bigger military and using the military to promote American values around the world while the more libertarian and paleoconservative factions of the party advocate for non interventionism Libertarian Republicans call for less government spending on defense 94 but paleoconservatives usually are pro strong national defense and therefore sometimes are in favor of more defense spending 95 The 1992 Republican Party platform adopted support for continuing to exclude homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline 90 The support for the exclusion of homosexuals from military service would remain in the Republican Party platform until the 2012 Republican Party platform which removed that language from it 96 A May 2012 United Technologies National Journal Congressional Connection Poll found that only 41 of Republicans supported restoring the prohibition against gays serving openly in the military 92 The 1992 Republican Party Party platform adopted opposition to including sexual preference into anti discrimination statutes 90 The 2000 Republican Party platform included the statement We support the First Amendment right of freedom of association and stand united with private organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America and support their positions 97 The 2004 Republican Party platform removed both parts of that language from the platform and stated that the party supports anti discrimination legislation 98 The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported anti discrimination statues based on sex race age religion creed disability or national origin but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity 96 99 A November December 2013 Public Religion Research Institute poll sponsored by the Ford Foundation found that 61 of Republicans support laws protecting gay and lesbian people against employment discrimination with only 33 opposing such laws 89 A 2007 Gallup poll showed 60 of Republicans supported expanding federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity with only 30 opposing such laws 100 The 2012 Republican Party platform opposes the Obama administration from attempting to impose what it considers a cultural agenda including a homosexual rights agenda in other countries by restricting foreign aid 96 However Republicans themselves have also frequently advocated for restricting foreign aid as a means of asserting the national security and immigration interests of the United States 101 102 103 The 2016 Republican Party Platform declares We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico s current status as a U S territory and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico Once the 2012 local vote for statehood is ratified Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico s future admission as the 51st state of the Union 104 Republicans supported Woodrow Wilson s call for American entry into World War I in 1917 complaining only that he was too slow to go to war Republicans in 1919 opposed his call for entry into the League of Nations A majority supported the League with reservations a minority opposed membership on any terms Republicans sponsored world disarmament in the 1920s and isolationism in the 1930s 105 Most Republicans staunchly opposed intervention in World War II until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 By 1945 however internationalists became dominant in the party which supported the Cold War policies such as the Truman Doctrine the Marshall Plan and NATO Many intellectual liberal Democrats in the 1960s and 1970s who became disenchanted with the leftward movement of their party often became neoconservatives neocons 106 Many became politically prominent during the five presidential terms under Reagan and the father son presidency from the Bush family They played a major role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq 107 Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld while not identifying themselves as neoconservatives listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy especially the defense of Israel the promotion of democracy in the Middle East and the buildup of American military forces to achieve these goals Neocons show a preference for unilateral American activism along with skepticism regarding the United Nations The neocons had little influence in the Obama White House but neoconservatism remains a staple in Republican Party arsenal 108 In June 2014 the Quinnipiac Poll asked Americans which foreign policy they preferred Democrats chose A over B by 65 32 Republicans chose A over B by 56 to 39 Independents chose A over B by 67 to 29 109 As a result some in the Republican Party support unilateralism on issues of national security believing in the ability and right of the United States to act without external support in matters of its national defense In general Republican thinking on defense and international relations is heavily influenced by the theories of neorealism and realism characterizing conflicts between nations as struggles between faceless forces of international structure as opposed to being the result of the ideas and actions of individual leaders The realist school s influence shows in Reagan s Evil Empire stance on the Soviet Union and George W Bush s Axis of evil Republicans secured gains in the 2002 and 2004 elections with the War on Terror being one of the top issues favoring them Since the September 11 2001 attacks some in the party support neoconservative policies with regard to the War on Terror including the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq The doctrine of preemptive war wars to disarm and destroy potential military foes based on speculation of future attacks rather than in defense against actual attack has been advocated by prominent members of the Bush administration but the war within Iraq has undercut the influence of this doctrine within the Republican Party Rudy Giuliani mayor of New York at the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 has stated his support for that policy saying America must keep itself on the offensive against terrorists The George W Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants saying they apply to soldiers serving in the armies of nation states and not terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda The Supreme Court overruled this position in Hamdan v Rumsfeld which held that the Geneva Conventions were legally binding and must be followed in regards to all enemy combatants Some prominent Republicans such as John McCain Mike Huckabee Ted Cruz and Ron Paul strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques which they view as torture 110 Republicans support the construction of the Keystone Pipeline which would connect the Athabasca oil sands in Canada to refineries in the United States American and Canadian environmentalists have strongly opposed the pipeline s construction although the Canadian government has lobbied for it 111 The Republican Party generally supports a strong alliance with Israel and efforts to secure peace in the Middle East between Israel and its Arab neighbors 112 113 The Republican Party says the U S should promote friendship not only between the United States and Russia but also between Russia and its neighbors Template CITATION NEEDED The party argues that with Russia the U S needs to display patience consistency and a principled reliance on democratic forces It also argues that Russia must stop encouraging the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 114 The party stresses the common interests of the two countries which include ending terrorism combating nuclear proliferation promoting bilateral trade 115 Leading Republicans have been split on how to respond to the Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Syria with some advocating a more hawkish approach and others urging a more cautious and conciliatory response 116 The party through former U N Ambassador John Bolton has advocated reforms in the United Nations to halt corruption such as that which afflicted the Oil for Food Program Most Republicans oppose the Kyoto Protocol The party promotes free trade agreements most notably North American Free Trade Agreement Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement and an effort to go further south to Brazil Peru and Colombia although some have a protectionist view of trade Republicans are divided on how to confront illegal immigration between a platform that allows for migrant workers and easing citizenship guidelines and border enforcement first approach In general pro growth advocates within the Republican Party and it support more immigration and traditional or populist conservatives oppose it In 2006 the White House supported and Republican led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens but the House also led by Republicans took an enforcement first approach and the bill failed to pass the conference committee 117 Lately after the defeat in the 2012 presidential elections and considering the low percent of Latino Americans that voted for Republicans several Republicans are advocating a friendlier approach to immigrants Former U S Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez is promoting the creation of a SuperPAC for immigration reform 118 Proposals calling for systematic reform of the U S immigration system such that residents that have come into the U S illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship have attracted broad Republican support in some polls For example the Public Religion Research Institute found in late 2013 that 60 of Republicans supported the pathway concept compared to 63 of Americans as a whole 119

Various yardsticks suggest the U S military or at least the officer corps which accounts for 17 of the 1 4 million strong active duty force leans Republican But they re not the monolithic bloc many believe U S Army soldiers walk inside a dining facility where posters urge them to vote in the military Camp Bondsteel in Sojevo Kosovo on Nov 2 2012 Follow TIMEPolitics Various yardsticks suggest the U S military or at least the officer corps which accounts for 17 of the 1 4 million strong active duty force leans Republican The nation s 24 million troops and veterans account for about 10 of the nation s potential voters but they re not the monolithic bloc many believe Outsiders tend to think the U S military is made up entirely of blood and gut conservatives à la John Wayne but there s little real evidence to back that up When the Iraq war was launched the consensus among U S military officers interviewed at the time was that one in three officers opposed it suggesting they all weren t gun ho The officers by and large are more conservative says an Army sergeant just back from Afghanistan But the enlisted tend to be more liberal Of course with fewer than one in five of those in uniform an officer there s a lot more enlisted voters But the U S military plainly tilts toward the GOP That s largely because today s military is an all volunteer force increasingly drawn from the Sunbelt where the Pentagon has focused its recruiting efforts since the draft ended 40 years ago And traits the military prizes like aggressiveness and respect for authority tend to be more pronounced in conservatives While the U S military assesses its force every which way here s the most recent demographic report it steers clear of asking about troops political views Military leaders have insisted for years that politics has no role in the U S military and that the only way to remain trustworthy is to stay resolutely nonpartisan Former and retired service members especially generals and admirals are connected to the military service for life Army General Martin Dempsey chairman of the Joint Chiefs said in June When the title or uniform is used for partisan purposes it can erode the trust relationship Of course not everyone particularly those who have retired agrees with Dempsey More than 300 retired generals and admirals have endorsed Republican Mitt Romney s bid for the presidency They re slated to take this advertisement in Monday s Washington Times newspaper boasting of their support President Obama hasn t released such a list although he can pocketed the recent endorsement of Colin Powell a retired Army general and secretary of state The independent Military Times newspapers conducted an voluntary survey among its members that shows them supporting Romney over Obama by a greater than 2 to 1 margin But the newspaper s subscribers are older and more senior in rank than the military as a whole and the fact that it s a self selected sample can further distort its findings Indeed there has been a conservative drift among U S military officers since the draft ended In a 2009 survey of 4 000 Army officers Heidi Urben an active duty officer and doctoral candidate at Georgetown University found that between 1976 and 1996 the share of senior military officers identifying itself as Republican jumped from one third to two thirds while those claiming to be moderates fell from 46 to 22 Senior military officers who described themselves as liberal fell from 16 in 1976 to 3 in 1996 Urben found that younger officers leaving the Army were far more likely to identify themselves as Democrats than those opting to stay which would tend to make the more senior ranks increasingly Republican Past surveys have shown senior military officers to generally be conservative and identify with the Republican Party a trend which has solidified with the advent and professionalism of the all volunteer force Urben wrote in her 2010 dissertation Meanwhile recent surveys suggest that the officer corps is more likely to be conservative and Republican than most enlisted Soldiers an important distinction to keep in mind considering enlisted Soldiers outnumber officers by four to one in the Army But there is conflicting evidence The Center for Responsive Politics reported last month that self described military personnel had donated 678 611 to Obama 85 more than the 398 450 the Romney campaign has collected Back to that sergeant who has just returned from Afghanistan While the troops are split over who they re supporting for president he says they re united on one thing they re upset that neither their current commander in chief nor his prospective replacement ever served a day in a U S military uniform That he says with a pained expression on his dogface is something they agree on

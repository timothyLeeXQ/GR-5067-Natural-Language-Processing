a clear choice this presidential election year The Democratic and Republican platforms show views of world 180 degrees apart The Democrats statement of principles encompassed many of Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders views giving him a victory even as he lost the presidential nomination to former U S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton The Republican platform shifted to the right of its nominee businessman Donald Trump amid concern that he wasn t conservative enough At 55 pages the Democratic document is 11 pages shorter than the GOP platform and mentioned Trump 29 times compared with just one of Clinton in the Republican document Here are 10 huge differences in the party platforms 1 ABORTION Democrats We believe unequivocally like the majority of Americans that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services including safe and legal abortion Republicans Abortion should be illegal in all cases and the Constitution should ve amended to ban the procedure We assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed the platform said The GOP argued that supporting the constitutional right to abortion was the extreme position 2 SAME SEX MARRIAGE Democrats Applauded the U S Supreme Court decision that legalized same sex marriage Republicans Condemned the court decision Five unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman the platform said 3 IMMIGRATION Democrats Called for fixing the broken immigration system including a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants Republicans Embraced Trump s call for a wall along the U S Mexican border though was silent on whether to back their nominee s demand to deport all 11 million 4 CLIMATE CHANGE Democrats Climate change poses a real and urgent threat to our economy our national security and our children s health and futures Republicans Cast doubts on whether the climate is changing rejecting the findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a political mechanism not an unbiased scientific institution with intolerance toward scientists and others who dissent from its orthodoxy 5 MEDICARE Democrats They would not only would fight any attempts by Republicans in Congress to privatize voucherize or phase out Medicare but would allow Americans older than 55 to enroll Republicans They would end the health care program for the elderly as we know it requiring seniors to either enroll in a private insurance plan or face limits on how much the government will pay 6 WALL STREET Democrats The party promised to vigorously implement enforce and build on banking regulations enacted to curb risky practices by financial institutions and will stop dead in its tracks every Republican effort to weaken it Republicans Blamed the Great Recession on the government s own housing policies not Wall Street actions and called the banking regulations an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation s financial markets 7 IRAN Democrats President Barack Obama s agreement to relax economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program verifiably cuts off all of Iran s pathways to a bomb without resorting to war Republicans The deal gravely threatens our security our interests and the survival of our friends The Republican platform called it a personal agreement between the president and his negotiating partners and non binding on the next president 8 ISRAEL Democrats The platform backed a secure and democratic Jewish state of Israel and a chance for Palestinians to govern themselves in their own viable state in peace and dignity Republicans While both parties support Israel the Republicans said nothing about the two state solution that has been the bipartisan cornerstone of U S foreign policy for decades 9 MONEY IN POLITICS Democrats They want to overturn the Citizens United decision which eased restrictions on corporate and union campaign spending We need to end secret unaccountable money in politics by requiring through executive order or legislation significantly more disclosure and transparency by outside groups federal contractors and public corporations to their shareholders the platform said Republicans I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves Trump said in accepting the Republican presidential nomination The GOP platform would make things much easier for the powerful It would repeal or raise contribution limits and allow outside groups spending millions on campaigns to hide their donors 10 VOTING RIGHTS Democrats The party said it would fight laws requiring certain forms of voter identification to preserve the fundamental right to vote A leader of the 1963 landmark Selma to Montgomery voting rights march Rep John Lewis D Ga helped nominate Clinton for president on Tuesday Republicans The GOP platform endorsed state efforts to impose voter identification requirements that the U S Justice Department and several federal and state courts have said discriminate against minority and poor voters The platform called Justice s actions bullying Cases of in person voter fraud which such voter ID laws are supposed to prevent are nearly non existent according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School Jonathan D Salant may be reached at jsalant njadvancemedia com Follow him on Twitter

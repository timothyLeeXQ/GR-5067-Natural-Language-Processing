 WASHINGTON More than three fourths of troops believe the military has become more politically polarized in recent years according to the results of a new Military Times poll of active duty service members And that ideological divide is sure to be a major player at the voting booth next month About 64 percent of active duty troops who took the anonymous survey said they are planning to cast a ballot in the congressional midterm elections in November even though turnout among the general public in midterm elections usually falls below 50 percent Only 7 percent of troops surveyed said they have no plans to vote this year The midterm elections could significantly shift the balance of power in the nation s capitol where Republicans currently hold control of the House Senate and White House They are also the latest benchmark in an increasingly fractured national political conversation which has seen escalating rhetoric from both sides What this shows is that the military as an institution is not immune to that said Peter Feaver a former adviser to former President George W Bush and a political science professor at Duke University who has authored several books on military culture It s not an oasis or an island Sign up for the Early Bird Brief a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe By giving us your email you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief And because of the value of the military as one of the few remaining apolitical institutions in America there are concerns that the military may be drawn into these partisan fights Feaver said Only 4 percent of troops surveyed believe the military has become less politicized in recent years A new Military Times poll shows that troops today are evenly split in their views about President Trump Who to vote for National polling suggests that Democrats have a strong possibility of gaining control of the House and possibly even the Senate moves that would have sweeping ramifications for President Donald Trump s policy and political priorities Troops see that possibility as well Nearly 74 percent of service members in the poll say they think the election will have a noticeable impact on the military with 28 percent of those calling it a significant effect Among officers that number is even higher 89 percent of them see this election as influential for the armed forces But who troops will vote for is less clear Almost half of those who responded to the poll said they do not affiliate with either major political party continuing a trend in Military Times polls from recent years away from close ties to either Republicans or Democrats Despite that roughly 45 percent of troops polled said they intend to back Republican candidates even though less than a third say they are registered with the party Similarly about 28 percent said they plan to vote for Democrats in the upcoming contests even though only about one fifth consider themselves members of that party Exit polling in the 2016 presidential election saw military members and veterans vote nearly two to one in favor of Republican candidates The Military Times poll doesn t show as big a disparity with troops this election cycle but that could shift given that more than 26 percent say they don t plan to support either party Troops surveyed had a 44 percent favorable view of Trump against a 43 percent unfavorable view Women minorities and officers had significantly lower opinions of his tenure and men and enlisted service members offered more support The survey showed broader approval of Trump s handling of military issues 60 percent say that the military is in better shape now than when President Barack Obama was in office but most think the military as a whole has weakened during their careers Almost 52 percent of troops surveyed said military readiness has weakened since their enlistment and 12 percent of the total characterized it as declining significantly Less than one third believe readiness is better today than when they joined their service The midterm elections will be held on Nov 6 Our methodology Between Sept 20 and Oct 2 Military Times in collaboration with the Institute for Veterans and Military Families IVMF at Syracuse University conducted a voluntary confidential online survey of U S service members The survey included 19 questions on service members

estimate the weights for each individual observation of the survey sample The margin of error for most questions was roughly 2 percent The survey audience was 89 percent male and 11 percent female and had an average age of about 31 years old The respondents identified themselves as 76 percent white 13 percent Hispanic 9 percent African American 5 percent Asian and 6 percent other ethnicities

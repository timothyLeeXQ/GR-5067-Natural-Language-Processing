 Photo Sara D Davis Getty Images America is the world aposs dominant superpower and white Christian males sit at the top of our nation aposs food chain That aposs the right and proper hierarchy and it aposs under serious threat When blue collar whites heard that implied message from Donald Trump many realized it aligned with their own beliefs As a result they broke with precedent to support the Republican candidate for president That aposs the conclusion of a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences the latest to analyze what drove Trump voters aside from traditional party affiliation Other recently published studies have pointed to the appeal of authoritarianism or plain old racism and sexism University of Pennsylvania political scientist Diana Mutz reports a key group of voters those who switched parties to vote for Trump were motivated by the vision of a frightening fall in social status In short they feared they were in the process of losing their previously privileged positions This thesis is hardly new In October of 2016 one month before the election we reported that reminding whites that America is on its way to becoming a minority majority country increased whites apos support for Trump Trump has successfully tapped into the threat to group status felt by many white Americans that researcher team wrote Mutz provides a strong confirmation of this thesis by comparing the voting behavior of more than 1 200 Americans a representative sample of the nation in 2012 and 2016 During surveys taken the month before each of the last two presidential elections participants reported which candidate they planned to vote for as well as their comfort level with their personal financial situation Most importantly they indicated their views on three key issues trade immigration and the United States apos relationship with China They were specifically asked whether the U S should have more or fewer trade agreements with other nations whether a pathway to U S citizenship should be offered to undocumented immigrants and whether China aposs emergence as a rival superpower is more an opportunity or a threat Mutz found that in 2012 the two parties candidate positions on trade as well as the average American aposs position were all but indistinguishable However by 2016 a large gap opened between the pro trade views of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the largely anti trade views of Trump whose attitude was much closer to that of the average American Similarly views on immigration and China became polarized with Trump asserting positions that were far closer to those of the average American Voters noticed this and many voted accordingly Voters who shifted parties to become Trump voters between the two elections seem to have done so because of increasing distance between their own views and that of the Democratic candidate on trade immigration and China Mutz reports Why were these policy positions so important All three of these issues capture potential racial and global status threat she writes Trade opposition captures Americans apos fear of takeover by more dominant economic powers while internally increased immigration threatens the supremacy of whites Participants also took short tests measuring their level of social dominance orientation the notion that superior groups should dominate inferior groups Those whose thinking moved in that dark direction between 2012 and 2016 were particularly likely to shift in support of Trump Mutz writes This indicates they felt a rising sense of threat to the dominant group aposs status These results suggest left wing thinkers such as Katrina vanden Huevel who argue these voters can be won back with policies that help them economically may be kidding themselves In many ways a sense of group threat is a much tougher opponent than an economic downturn because it is a psychological mindset Mutz concludes Given current demographic trends within the U S minority influence will only increase with time thus heightening this source of perceived status threat And don apost think for a moment that this attitude was exclusively held by men A second new study looks specifically at female Trump voters and finds that much like their male counterparts they were largely driven by racial resentment and support of traditional gender roles In the journal PS Political Science and Politics High Point University political scientists Mark Setzler and Alixandra Yanus analyzed data from the 2016 American National Election Study They found that somewhat to their surprise the same factors that attracted men to Trump aposs campaign and messaging explain his support among women Controlling for the influence of other factors they write possessing the levels of sexism and racism for the typical female Trump voter increased the probability that a woman would vote for him by 37 percentage points By comparison being a female Republican increased the probability that a woman voted for Trump by 29 points The results suggest many women fear how aposoutsider groups apos may be altering the political landscape an attitude that observers attribute primarily to angry white men The researchers note that while the much discussed gender gap was the largest ever in 2016 it was only modestly greater than in 2012 Many women they write feel trepidation towards the loss of apostraditional American family values apos including the preservation of separate spheres for men and women Both studies point in the same direction The 2016 election was largely about fear of change Many people see an increasingly interdependent world and an increasingly multicultural America as threats to their well being Unless that attitude can somehow be softened our era of ugly politics may be just beginning Tom Jacobs is a senior staff writer at Pacific Standard where he specializes in social science culture and learning He

science culture and learning He is a veteran journalist and former staff writer for the Los Angeles Daily News and the Santa Barbara News Press A new analysis finds attitudes about gender and race were far better predictors of support for Trump than personal economic woes A political scientist offers some preliminary thoughts on why the election results surprised pretty much everyone Research on Iowa counties that swung from Obama to Trump indicates that GOP success was driven far more by sexism and racism than by economic anxiety Donald Trump has succeeded in making blue state America miserable again New research finds the president s earliest and strongest followers embody a particularly belligerent strain of authoritarian thinking New research finds liberals and libertarians are

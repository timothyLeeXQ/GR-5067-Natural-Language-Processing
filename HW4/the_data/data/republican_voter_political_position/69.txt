Follow lizhamel on Twitter Bianca DiJulio Cailey Muñana and Mollyann Brodie Follow Mollybrodie on Twitter Published Oct 18 2018 Poll As Midterms Approach Health Care Remains Voters Top Issue But President Trump and Other Factors Also Loom Large In Bellwether Elections in Florida and Nevada Voters Want Candidates to Protect People with Pre Existing Conditions from Insurance Discrimination Leading up to the 2018 midterm elections seven in ten voters 71 percent say health care is very important in making their voting decision for Congress this year slightly larger than the shares that say the same about the economy and jobs 64 percent Majorities also say the same about gun policy 60 percent immigration 55 percent tax cuts and tax reform 53 percent and foreign policy 51 percent While at least half of voters say all of the issues provided are very important to their vote when asked to choose the one issue that is the most important in their voting decision for Congress this year the largest share of voters chooses health care 30 percent This is followed by the economy and jobs 21 percent gun policy 15 percent and immigration 15 percent This is consistent with previous KFF polling throughout the 2018 midterm cycle which has regularly found health care among the top issues voters want to hear candidates talk about during their campaigns Figure 1 Health Care Is Top Issue For Voters In the Midterm Elections Health care is also chosen as the most important issue by Democratic voters 40 percent and independent voters 31 percent but ranks lower for Republican voters 17 percent behind immigration 25 percent and the economy and jobs 23 percent and similar to gun policy 17 percent Figure 2 Health Care Tops Issues Among Democratic And Independent Voters Ranks Lower Among Republican Voters Health care is also the top issue chosen by voters who live in battleground areas 28 percent ranking above the economy and jobs 22 percent immigration 16 percent gun policy 15 percent tax cuts and tax reform 8 percent and foreign policy 5 percent 2018 Midterm Election Analysis As part of Kaiser Family Foundation s effort to examine the role of health care in the 2018 midterm elections throughout the year we will be tracking the views of voters paying special attention to those living in states or congressional districts in which both parties have a viable path to win the election This group referred to in our analysis as voters in battlegrounds is defined by the 2018 Senate House and Governor ratings provided by The Cook Political Report Congressional and Governor races categorized as toss up were included in this group A complete list of the states and congressional districts included in the comparison group is available in Appendix A While health care is the top issue for voters living in battleground areas overall similar to the national picture the ranking of issues varies by partisanship Nearly four in ten Democratic battleground voters 37 percent chose health care as the most important issue in their voting decision for Congress this year as did three in ten independent battleground voters 28 percent making it among the top issues for both groups However among Republican battleground voters immigration is the top issue 29 percent while health care ranks among other issues such as gun policy 16 percent and the economy and jobs 15 percent Although health care is a top issue for voters leading into the midterm elections less than half of voters say they are hearing a lot from political candidates about specific health care issues While a majority of voters say they are hearing a lot from political candidates about immigration 58 percent and half say they are hearing a lot about the candidates support for or opposition to President Trump 48 percent fewer voters say they are hearing a lot about health care issues such as the ongoing prescription painkiller addiction epidemic 38 percent the 2010 health care law 35 percent and continuing protections for people with pre existing conditions 23 percent Even fewer voters say they have heard about a national health plan or Medicare for all plan 17 percent the future of Medicare 17 percent or unexpected or surprise medical bills 11 percent Figure 3 Voters Say They Are Hearing About Immigration President Trump From 2018 Candidates There are thirteen gubernatorial elections taking place this fall in states that have not expanded their Medicaid programs as part of the implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act ACA as well as four states where Medicaid expansion is on the ballot Utah Idaho Nebraska and Montana In states without Medicaid expansion few voters say they have heard a lot about this issue 15 percent As in previous KFF Tracking Polls this month s tracking poll continues to find health care costs as one of the top health care issues to voters When voters who say health care is very important to their decision about who to vote for are asked to say in their own words what health care issue they mean one fourth 24 percent of all voters offer health care costs including prescription drug costs Voters also mention increasing access to health care 19 percent of all voters Fewer voters mention opposition to or repealing the ACA 8 percent of all voters Medicare or senior concerns 7 percent of all voters or concerns about quality of coverage or care 5 percent of all voters A small share of voters mention either positively or negatively single payer or Medicare for all 4 percent of all voters Figure 4 Health Care Costs Increased Access Are Top Health Care Issues For Voters Health care costs are also among the top health care issue offered by all partisan voters including about one fourth of independent voters 27 percent and Republican voters 23 percent and about one fifth of Democratic voters 22 percent Other issues vary by partisanship with three in ten Democratic voters offering increased access 31 percent as the most important health care issue while one fifth of Republican voters 18 percent offer opposition to repealing the ACA Figure 5 Health Care Costs Is Among The Top Health Care Issues Across Partisans Health Care Voters Over the past six months the Kaiser Family Foundation has been tracking a unique group of voters health care voters When asked how important a series of issues will be in their 2018 congressional vote choice these voters say health care is the most important issue The share of voters who are categorized as health care voters has increased only slightly over the past six months from 23 percent to 30 percent of all voters To compare the demographic profile of health care voters to other voters see our health care voter interactive In addition to candidates position on issues other factors could play a role in voters decisions about who to vote for this year When asked which will play a bigger role in their voting decisions six in ten voters 57 percent say the candidates positions on specific issues will play a bigger role in their decision about who to vote for than the broader political environment including a candidate s support for or opposition to President Trump 38 percent Larger shares of independent voters 64 percent and Democratic voters 56 percent prioritize the candidates positions on specific issues while Republican voters are more divided with similar shares saying candidates positions on issues 49 percent and the broader political environment 48 percent will play the biggest role Voters in battleground areas also say they prioritize candidates positions on issues 58 percent vs 38 percent Figure 6 More Voters Say Issues Will Matter More Than Politics During Upcoming Election Yet majorities of voters say various political and candidate dynamics will be major factors in 2018 At least two thirds of voters say the candidates character and experience 73 percent which party controls Congress 66 percent or the candidates support for or opposition to President Trump 66 percent will be a major factor in their voting decision for Congress this year Fewer voters say the same about the candidates political party 51 percent Despite the recent attention to the increase in female candidates running in 2018 a majority of voters 78 percent say the candidates gender is not a factor in their voting decisions Figure 7 Majority Of Voters Say Candidate Characteristics And Politics Will Be Major Factors In 2018 Vote A larger share of Democratic voters 81 percent say candidate dynamics such as their character and experience will be a major factor in their voting decisions compared to Republican voters 69 percent and independent voters 68 percent In addition eight in ten Democratic voters say a candidate s position on President Trump 79 percent will be a major factor compared to two thirds of Republican voters and half 53 percent of independent voters Majorities of both Democratic voters 78 percent and Republican voters 73 percent say that political dynamics such as which party controls Congress as well as the candidates political parties will be major factors in voting decisions 63 percent and 62 percent respectively In addition to this month s KFF Health Tracking Poll this report also includes two state based surveys Florida and Nevada Both of these bellwether states have competitive Gubernatorial and Senate elections in which candidates are campaigning on various health care issues According to a recent report from the Wesleyan Media Project two thirds of Nevada Senate and congressional campaign advertisements during September focused on health care issues as did one fourth of Florida Senate and congressional campaign ads 1 Health care is the top issue among Florida voters 26 percent and among the top issues for Nevada voters 24 percent along with immigration 23 percent and the economy and jobs 21 percent Figure 8 Health Care Is Top Issue In Florida And Ranks Among Top Issues In Nevada Similar to the national findings when asked what they mean when they say health care is very important to their vote in 2018 Florida and Nevada voters most frequently mention health care costs Three in ten Florida voters 29 percent mention health care costs as do one fourth of Nevada voters 24 percent Health care costs were also among the most frequently mentioned health care issue across partisan voters in both bellwether states but other issues in each of the states vary slightly across party identification While health care is a top national issue the role that candidates positions on specific health care issues play in elections can vary in states and by party identification This month s look at the role of health care in two bellwether states finds that majorities of voters in Florida and Nevada say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to maintain the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions voters are more divided on whether they would vote for a candidate who holds other health care positions A majority of Florida voters 69 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to maintain the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions while few 9 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to eliminate these protections regardless of the fact that this may lead to increased costs for some healthy people On the other five health care issues provided no one side of the position received majority support About half of Florida voters say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to expand Medicaid 49 percent supports increasing regulation of prescription drug prices 47 percent or wants to increase women s access to reproductive health services 47 percent in each case substantially larger than the share who say they d be more likely to vote for a candidate who takes the opposite position A slightly larger share of Florida voters 43 percent vs 33 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports passing a national health plan a proposal being pushed by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum When it comes to the ACA Florida voters are divided with similar shares saying they are more likely to support a candidate who wants to repeal or protect the ACA Figure 9 Most Florida Voters Say They Are More Likely To Vote For Candidate Who Supports Pre Existing Condition Protections Similarly seven in ten Nevada voters 68 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to maintain the ACA protections for people with pre existing conditions In addition a slight majority of Nevada voters 53 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to increase women s access to reproductive health services while one in five 18 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to decrease access Nearly half of Nevada voters also say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to protect the ACA 47 percent or supports passing a national health plan or Medicare for all 47 percent while about three in ten say they d be more likely to vote for a candidate who takes the opposite position on each of these issues Nevada voters are more divided on the regulation of prescription drug prices with similar shares saying they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports increasing regulation 39 percent as opposes increasing regulation 32 percent Figure 10 Most Nevada Voters Will Vote For Candidates Who Support Pre Existing Protections Access To Reproductive Services Significant shares of partisan voters in Florida and Nevada say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to maintain the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions including majorities of Democratic voters 90 percent and 71 percent in Florida and Nevada respectively independent voters 73 percent and 72 percent respectively and a majority Republican voters in Nevada 60 percent and nearly half of Republican voters in Florida 46 percent Figure 11 Large Shares Of Florida And Nevada Voters Say They Will Vote For Candidate Who Maintains Pre Existing Conditions One reason why maintaining the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions is a popular candidate position in both bellwether states may be because slightly more than half of Nevadans 55 percent and Floridians 54 percent live in households with someone who has a pre existing condition This is consistent with the share of the public overall who live in households with someone who has a pre existing condition 53 percent Figure 12 Slightly More Than Half Of Florida And Nevada Residents Say They Or Household Member Has Pre Existing Condition The KFF Tracking Poll also asked Florida and Nevada voters which of the provided health care positions was the most important to their vote choice this fall No one position garnered majority support with partisans in both states selecting various party platforms as most important Three in ten Republican voters in Florida 31 percent say repealing the ACA is the most important candidate position on a health care issue in determining their vote for Congress On the other hand nearly one fourth of independent voters 23 percent and two in ten Democratic voters 21 percent in Florida say a candidate supporting a national health plan or Medicare for all plan is the most important health care position for a candidate to take in determining their vote The only health care position that ranks among the top three for all partisan voters in Florida is maintaining the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions with more than one in ten Democratic voters 18 percent independent voters 15 percent and Republican voters 12 percent saying this is the most important position in determining their vote Figure 13 Florida Voters Divided On Which Health Care Position Matters Most To Their Vote Similar to Florida three in ten Republican voters 29 percent in Nevada say repealing the ACA is the most important candidate position on a health care issue in determining their vote for Congress On the other hand a nearly similar share of Democratic voters 31 percent say a candidate supporting a national health plan or Medicare for all plan is the most important health care position for a candidate to take in determining their vote For independent voters in the state continuing the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions tops the list of candidate positions on health care issues 27 percent Once again maintaining the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions is the only health care position that ranks among the top three for all partisan voters in Nevada 24 percent of Republicans and 21 percent of Democrats Figure 14 Nevada Voters Choose Pre Existing Condition Protections And Partisan Issues As Most Important Health Care Positions Poll Most Florida Voters Favor Expanding Medicaid in their State As Do Voters across All Non Expansion States As of October 2018 Florida is one of 17 states who have not expanded their Medicaid programs 2 Majorities of Democratic voters 74 percent and independent voters 53 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to expand Medicaid to cover more low income uninsured adults while a majority of Republican voters in the state 52 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to keep Medicaid as is Nearly one fourth of Republican voters 22 percent say that a candidate s position on this issue doesn t make a difference in their vote choice as do one fifth of independent voters 19 percent and one in seven Democratic voters 15 percent Figure 15 Partisan Voters Divided On Whether They Are More Likely To Vote For Candidate Who Wants To Expand Medicaid Overall support for Medicaid expansion in Florida is similar to the share seen in other non expansion states with nearly six in ten residents saying their state should expand Medicaid while nearly four in ten say their state should keep Medicaid as it is today Figure 16 Majorities In Non Expansion States Support Medicaid Expansion With competitive gubernatorial elections this fall this poll also asked the public which gubernatorial candidate they trust on key health care issues Overall the Democratic candidate in Florida has a clear advantage on most health care issues while in Nevada the Republican candidate has an advantage on some spending issues and the public is more divided on other issues When looking at the gubernatorial election in Florida a larger share of Floridians say they trust Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum than Republican candidate Ron DeSantis to do a better job on health care issues with some notable exceptions Similar shares say they trust each candidate to do a better job of addressing the prescription painkiller addiction epidemic 37 percent vs 34 percent respectively and controlling Medicaid spending 36 percent for both Floridians gave a slight edge to Gillum on improving rural health care 40 percent vs 32 percent and reducing health care costs 40 percent vs 33 percent Figure 17 Larger Shares Of Floridians Say They Trust Democratic Governor Candidate On Key Health Care Issues In Nevada a larger share say they trust Republican candidate Adam Laxalt than his Democratic challenger Steve Sisolak to do a better job reducing health care costs 36 percent vs 26 percent addressing the prescription painkiller addiction epidemic 37 percent vs 24 percent and controlling Medicaid spending 40 percent vs 22 percent Nevadans are divided on which gubernatorial candidate they trust to do a better job on continuing the ACA s protections for people with pre existing conditions with one third saying they trust Republican candidate Laxalt compared to three in ten who say they trust Democratic candidate Sisolak Figure 18 Larger Share Of Nevadans Trust Republican Candidate On Opioid Addiction Epidemic Health Care Costs And Spending One of the major narratives throughout this election cycle has been the impact that women voters may have on issues and candidates with ongoing attention to the MeToo Movement especially in light of Justice Kavanaugh s confirmation hearing and primary wins by female candidates In July the KFF Tracking Poll examined which women s issues may be playing a role in voters decisions as well as the views of women 18 44 years old The most recent tracking poll which was conducted during the Senate judiciary hearings on allegations against Justice Kavanaugh s finds that nearly half of women voters overall and women voters in Florida and Nevada are more enthusiastic about voting in this year s election 3 Figure 19 About Half Of Women Voters Say They Are More Enthusiastic About Voting In This Year s Election Nationally independent women voters 30 percent and Republican women voters 45 percent are about as enthusiastic as their male counterparts 31 percent and 42 percent respectively while Democratic women voters report slightly higher levels of enthusiasm about voting in this year s election 55 percent compared to Democratic men voters 48 percent Across the board enthusiasm about voting is higher in 2018 than it was in the last midterm elections in 2014 Yet few women voters say the candidates gender will be a major factor 6 percent in their decision about who to vote for Congress this year One in five 19 percent say the candidates gender will be a minor factor while three fourths say it won t be a factor This is similar across women voters regardless of party identification with seven percent of Democratic women voters saying the candidates gender will be a major factor compared to four percent of Republican women voters and independent women voters Figure 20 Most Women Voters Say Candidates Gender Isn t A Factor In Voting Decision Health care is among the top issue for women voters regardless of party identification and across states More than one third of women voters overall 36 percent say health care is the most important issue in deciding who to vote for Congress including four in ten Democratic women voters 43 percent and independent women voters 38 percent and one fifth of Republican women voters 22 percent Figure 21 Health Care Is A Top Issue

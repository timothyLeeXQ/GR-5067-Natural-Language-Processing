as the Grand Old Party or the GOP The party s main counterpart is the Democratic Party The Grand Old Party nickname which had previously been used by Southern Democrats was applied to the Republican Party following the 1888 election cycle At the time Republicans had regained control of the presidency and Congress for the first time since the Grant administration The Chicago Tribune proclaimed Let us be thankful that under the rule of the Grand Old Party these United States will resume the onward and upward march which the election of Grover Cleveland in 1884 partially arrested 1 The party s principal governing organization is the Republican National Committee RNC which is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy It is also responsible for organizing and running the Republican National Convention every four years The modern GOP supports a conservative platform on the American political spectrum with foundations in laissez faire capitalism low taxes supply side fiscal policies and social conservatism 1 2 3 4 5 Party members typically but do not always or uniformly favor the following

was founded in 1854 in Ripon Wisconsin by anti slavery expansion activists and modernizers The fledgling party quickly surpassed the Whig Party as the principal opposition to the Democratic Party In 1860 the GOP rose to power upon the election of former President Abraham Lincoln R The party maintained strength through the American Civil War and Reconstruction The party s official logo the elephant is derived from a cartoon by Thomas Nast 2 The website for the Republican National Committee RNC provides the following history of the GOP 8 On July 6 1854 just after the anniversary of the nation an anti slavery state convention was held in Jackson Michigan The hot day forced the large crowd outside to a nearby oak grove At this Under the Oaks Convention the first statewide candidates were selected for what would become the Republican Party United by desire to abolish slavery it was in Jackson that the Platform of the Under the Oaks Convention read we will cooperate and be known as REPUBLICANS Prior to July smaller groups had gathered in intimate settings like the schoolhouse in Ripon Wisconsin However the meeting in Jackson would be the first ever mass gathering of the Republican Party The name Republican was chosen alluding to Thomas Jefferson s Democratic Republican Party and conveying a commitment to the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Party of Freedom Though popularized in a Thomas Nast cartoon the GOP s elephant symbol originated during the 1860 campaign as a symbol of Republican strength Republicans envisioned free soil free speech free labor Under the leadership of President Abraham Lincoln the GOP became the Party of the Union as well President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation but it was the entire Republican Party who freed the slaves The 1864 Republican National Convention called for the abolition of slavery and Congressional Republicans passed the 13th Amendment unanimously with only a few Democrat votes The early women s rights movement was solidly Republican as it was a continuation of abolitionism They were careful not to be overly partisan but as did Susan B Anthony most suffragists favored the GOP The 19th Amendment was written by a Republican senator and garnered greater support from Republicans than from Democrats Party of Prosperity Low taxes sound money regulatory restraint these were among the commonsense economic policies established by the GOP that brought about decades of prosperity after the Civil War Republicans encouraged innovation and rule of law Buttressed by Republican control in Congress the McKinley Theodore Roosevelt and Taft administrations cleared away obstacles to economic growth President Dwight Eisenhower and congressional Republicans appreciated the fact that the private sector not government is the engine of wealth creation With his bold tax cutting agenda President Ronald Reagan revived the economy after years of Democrat malaise Party of Vision Theodore Roosevelt embodies our Party s traditional concern for the environment but the Republican commitment to the environment actually goes back much further than that For example the world s first national park Yellowstone was established during the Ulysses Grant administration President Eisenhower advocated groundbreaking civil rights legislation and vigorously enforced the Brown v Board of Education decision sending the 101st Airborne to Little Rock when chaos erupted following integration at Central High Ronald Reagan explained the difference between Democrats and Republicans in a way that cannot be improved upon Two visions of the future two fundamentally different ways of governing their government of pessimism fear and limits or ours of hope confidence and growth Their government sees people only as members of groups Ours serves all the people of America as individuals President George H W Bush championed community and volunteer organizations and the tremendous power they have for doing good He famously described them as a brilliant diversity spread like stars like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky In the first decade of the 21st century President George W Bush made an unprecedented commitment to helping those in need beyond our shores through the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief PEPFAR an aid program for countries devastated by HIV AIDS Since its inception PEPFAR has saved over a million lives and currently provides over 5 million people with life saving treatments Party of Strength President Reagan and President George H W Bush led western democracies to victory over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War The George W Bush administration maintained the military second to none and projected that power in the fight against international terrorism Party of the Future Drawing inspiration from our Party s history today s Republicans believe individuals not government make the best decisions all people are entitled to equal rights and decisions are best made close to home At the state level the nation s thirty Republican governors are making government more effective and efficient spurring economic growth and striving to put more power in the hands of the people Nationally Republicans recognize that the slow bloated top down Washington bureaucracy is out of date in the 21st century Our Party works to give Americans more choices in healthcare in education in energy and in the economy and to free individuals and families from the intrusive overreach of federal bureaucrats The Party s core principles of freedom and equal opportunity are as relevant today as at our founding and they are the roadmap for American renewal in a new and interconnected world 9 The following table lists the

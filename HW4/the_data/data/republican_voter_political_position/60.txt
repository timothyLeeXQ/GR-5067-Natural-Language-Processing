discussion By Joshua Gillin on Monday August 24th 2015 at 5 25 p m After losing ground to Donald Trump in the polls following the first GOP presidential debate Jeb Bush has gone on the attack questioning the real estate mogul s Republican bona fides Mr Trump doesn t have a proven conservative record Bush said at a town hall in Merrimack N H on Aug 19 2015 He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican Bush also said Trump has given more money to Democrats than he has given to Republicans a claim we ve previously rated Mostly False Bush tweeted video of the town hall the same night calling Trump a tax hiking Democrat In his defense Trump said on Face The Nation on Aug 23 that living in Manhattan for years affected his alignment I was from an area that was all Democrat Trump said And frankly over the years I have and especially as I have gotten more and more involved I have evolved We know Trump has changed his political affiliation several times over the years but we wanted to figure out just when and how the billionaire liked to party Choosing sides Trump has regularly said that he has a broad range of political positions I identify with some things as a Democrat he told MSNBC in July He had told CNN the same thing back in 2004 He s also expressed interest in running as a third party candidate According to the New York City Board of Elections Trump has changed his party affiliation five times since registering as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987 A form that year notes he had previously been registered in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens where he grew up but his prior affiliation was not identified Trump s affiliations have gone back and forth since then Here s a quick look Month and year of registration Party affiliation July 1987 Republican October 1999 Independence Party August 2001 Democrat September 2009 Republican December 2011 No party affiliation independent April 2012 Republican We don t need to go back as far as 1987 for this check of course but it shows Trump has switched quite a bit After 12 years as a Republican he registered with the Independence Party in 1999 That moved Trump to New York s version of the Reform Party which is neither Democratic nor Republican He even won the Reform Party s California primary for president in March 2000 despite withdrawing from that contest Bush s campaign told us that the last decade meant when Trump was registered from 2000 to 2010 Trump was registered as a Democrat for 8 years 1 month in that time span But we think a reasonable person could mistake the last decade to mean the last 10 years When we added up the years since 2005 we found Trump has been registered as a Democrat for 3 years 9 months and registered as Republican for 5 years 6 months and counting Media reports said Trump s switch in December 2011 where he checked I do not wish to enroll in a party made him an independent voter before the 2012 presidential election in which he considered running himself His attorney Michael Cohen told Politico that Trump made the change in order to preserve his right to run as an independent if he is not pleased with the GOP nominee Trump decided not to run that year He switched back to Republican in April 2012 One last note Party affiliation in New York matters for who a person can vote for in a primary contest because New York has a closed primary just like Florida If someone wants to vote in a primary they must be registered to that party But according to a partial voting record from New York state Trump hasn t cast a ballot in at least the last two presidential primaries Our ruling Bush said Trump was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican The Bush campaign said he meant 2000 to 2010 during which Trump was a Democrat for a bit over nine years Trump had largely been a Republican in the years prior to that If that s what Bush meant he phrased his statement poorly When we reviewed Trump s voter registration in the 10 years leading up to the present from 2005 to 2015 we found that he has been a Republican for more than five years He was a registered Democrat for not quite four years in that time frame The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context We rate it Half True Published Monday August 24th 2015 at 5 25 p m Researched by Joshua

 Download Download Demographics are not destiny but steady and predictable changes to the electorate play an important role in defining the landscape of American politics Most demographic groups have a political lean so a group increasing or decreasing in size over time will tend to benefit one party or type of politics over another The most well known example is the growth of the nonwhite population in the United States which since nonwhites tend to lean heavily Democratic is typically viewed as tilting the electoral terrain somewhat toward the Democrats over time as well as increasing the weight of nonwhite voters within the Democratic Party over time But other changes are important such as the decline of noncollege educated voters particularly whites the aging of the adult population and the rise of new generations to replace older ones In this report we will explore the effect of these changes on the demographic composition of the electorate and especially on the composition of the two major political parties Reflecting the latter focus this analysis will not focus on how many individuals from a given demographic group voted or will likely vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in a particular election Rather it focuses on how many people who voted or are likely to vote for the Democratic or Republican candidate in a particular election belong to a given demographic group While the former tells us about the political leanings of a given group the latter answers different questions While size is not the sole determinant of a group s influence within a party it is a significant input and affects how parties formulate positions and present themselves to the electorate As we head into the 2020 presidential primaries we are bound to observe the effects of party composition on how candidates for the presidential nomination especially Democratic candidates due to their intense competition for voters position themselves to garner primary votes from different demographic groups within their party Our investigation turns up a number of key findings that illuminate how significantly the compositions of the Democratic and Republican parties have changed over the years and are likely to change in the future We show that the 2016 election was the most graphically divisive election in the past 36 years The parties were more divided by age race and education than in any prior election in modern political history Reflecting these intensifying divisions the parties were more compositionally different in 2016 than at any point in the prior 36 years This election was the first presidential election white noncollege voters did not make up a plurality of both parties coalitions with white college voters exceeding the share of white noncollege voters in the Democratic coalition Nonwhites will continue to grow as a share of both parties coalitions especially Hispanics We find that by 2032 Hispanic voters will surpass black voters as the largest overall nonwhite voting group And by 2036 black voters will make up a larger share of the Democratic coalition than white noncollege voters On the other hand we find that white voters will continue to decline through 2036 as a share of both the Republican and Democratic party coalitions though this decline with be considerably quicker in fast growing states such as Arizona and Texas that are already less white White noncollege voters in particular are projected to decline rapidly as a share of both parties coalitions across all states through 2036 although the sharpest declines will again be in fast growing states Generational changes will also be substantial By 2036 Millennial and Generation Z voters the two youngest generations will be heavily represented in both the Democratic Party and Republican Party coalitions while the influence of Baby Boomer and the Silent Generation voters the two oldest generations will radically decline White Millennial and Generation Z voters in particular will develop a large presence in the Republican coalition and combined with nonwhites will give the GOP a new look in all states even slowgrowing ones such as Wisconsin and Ohio Finally our data indicate that while shifting turnout and support rates can be pivotal for winning elections these changes are likely to have a relatively small impact on the overall makeup of the electorate and party coalitions in the future Thus most of the effect of demographic change on future party coalitions is already baked in and will reshape party coalitions in a sense whether these parties like it or not Get city and regional policy updates from Brookings

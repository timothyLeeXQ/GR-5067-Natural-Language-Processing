party about its strategy and future Here are six facts about Democrats today 1Self identified liberals make up a larger share of the Democratic Party than they once did Nearly half of all Democrats and Democratic leaning independents 46 describe their political views as liberal an increase of 17 percentage points since 2003 Today 39 of Democrats say they are moderate while just 14 are conservative 2Democratic voters have become much more racially and ethnically diverse over the past two decades The next generation of Americans will be the country s most diverse yet Democrats are changing to reflect the nation s growing racial and ethnic diversity more quickly than Republicans In 2017 59 of Democratic and Democratic leaning registered voters were non Hispanic whites down from 75 two decades earlier The share of Democratic voters who are black Hispanic Asian American or of another race has increased from 24 to 39 over this period Non Hispanic whites made up an overwhelming share of Republican voters in 2017 83 in 1997 92 of GOP voters were white non Hispanics 3There is less division among Democrats than in the past on the issues of immigration same sex marriage and racial equality A decade ago there was more significant disagreement among Democrats over these issues with the party nearly evenly split Today three quarters of Democrats or more are in agreement on these issues In 2009 about half of Democrats 52 said immigrants strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents Earlier this year 83 of Democrats said immigrants did more to strengthen than burden the country A similar shift has occurred on same sex marriage and views of the state of racial equality In 2009 Democrats were divided in their views of same sex marriage today three

protecting the environment 74 and making Medicare financially sound 73 Democrats and Republicans differed on the importance of most of the 18 policy goals in the survey but the widest gaps were over

majorities of Democrats at least 85 in each case say they are often or sometimes concerned exhausted angry insulted and confused by the things that Trump says 6Majorities of Democrats say the gender race or sexuality of the Democratic nominee in 2020 wouldn t make a difference in their enthusiasm Nearly two thirds of Democrats 64 say it would not make a difference in their enthusiasm if the party s nominee is a woman while nearly a third 31 say they would feel more enthusiastic Among Democratic women younger than 50 45 say they would be more enthused over a woman nominee compared with 28 of

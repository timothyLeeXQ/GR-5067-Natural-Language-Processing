pushing for higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans Moderate Democrats led by Joe Biden prefer a more tempered stance focused on formulating bipartisan solutions they argue are more practical Others

TOM STEYER TULSI GABBARD MICHAEL BENNET MARIANNE WILLIAMSON STEVE BULLOCK JOHN DELANEY TOM SESTAK WAYNE MESSAM Warren has voiced support for the idea of Medicare for All but the candidate who seems to have a plan for everything has been uncharacteristically vague about how she would execute such a massive undertaking During a CNN town hall in March she only expressed a desire to get everybody at the table including private insurance companies whom she envisions playing a temporary role in any transition toward a single payer system She changed course a few months later during the first Democratic debates however raising her hand in favor of eliminating the private insurance industry Look at the business model of an insurance company she said It s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care That leaves families with rising premiums rising copays and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need Medicare for All solves that problem Warren has the most aggressive tax the rich proposal in the field Under her Ultra Millionaire wealth tax households with a net worth of more than 50 million would be taxed 2 percent on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 3 percent on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion Warren estimates the tax which would apply to about 75 000 households would bring in 2 75 trillion in revenue over 10 years Warren s Green Manufacturing Plan takes inspiration from both the Apollo program and the Marshall Plan to develop manufacture and export the technology the world needs to confront the existential threat of climate change The plan would divide a 2 trillion 10 year investment among three priorities clean energy research and development a massive investment to encourage the manufacture of clean renewable and emission free energy products and a diplomatic program to encourage other countries to use clean American technology Warren has also released a plan to ready the military for threats associated with climate change Under that plan the Pentagon would have to achieve net zero emissions by 2030 and the Defense Department would invest billions of dollars into a new 10 year research and development program focused on microgrids and advanced energy storage Arguing that crushing student loan debt is reducing rates of homeownership discouraging people from starting businesses and forcing students to drop out before graduating Warren has declared that she would cancel up to 50 000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans almost completely wiping out educational debt for three quarters of the country s borrowers To prevent future generations from becoming similarly buried in student debt Warren has proposed offering every American the chance to go to a two or four year college for free The cost Warren says will be covered by the tax on her Ultra Millionaire tax In March Warren released a plan to break up Facebook Google and Amazon companies she argues have too much power over our economy our society and our democracy Central to her plan is designating companies with an annual revenue of more than 25 billion and which offers an online marketplace an exchange or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as a Platform Utilities which would have to abide by a set of regulations relating to their interactions with users and would not be able to share data with third parties She would also appoint regulators to reverse illegal and anti competitive tech mergers for example Amazon s acquisition of Whole Foods We must help America s content creators from local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicians keep more of the value their content generates rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook Warren wrote Giant tech companies have too much power My plan to BreakUpBigTech prevents corporations like Amazon from knocking out the rest of the competition You can be an umpire or you can be a player but you can t be both WarrenTownHall pic twitter com 73y1002QVv Elizabeth Warren ewarren April 23 2019 Warren announced early on in her campaign that she would not court or accept contributions from big money donors a decision that ultimately resulted in her finance director quitting the campaign He reportedly strenuously objected on the grounds that the move would kneecap her candidacy right out of the gate Warren who said in 2014 that she grew up around guns and gun owners and that she will work to protect the rights of law abiding citizens has more recently joined other senators in calling for research into the public health consequences of gun violence and for hearings on universal background checks In January she co sponsored an assault weapons ban bill and in February she said gun violence would be qualified as a national emergency if she were elected In June Warren tweeted that she supports a national gun licensing program that would require Americans to hold a license before purchasing a gun and that she also wants to ban assault weapons prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms and closing the gun show loophole After the August shootings that left 31 dead in El Paso and Dayton however Warren unveiled a wide ranging plan aimed at reducing gun violence by 80 percent The plan is essentially three pronged Warren would take several executive actions to institute gun control measures like universal background checks prosecuting gun traffickers and more passing anti corruption legislation that would end the NRA s stranglehold on Congress and sending Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation that would be revisited and tweaked on an annual basis I ll make sure that the NRA and their cronies are held accountable with executive action Warren wrote on Medium If we turn our heartbreak and our anger into action I know we can take the power from the NRA and the lawmakers in their pockets and return it to the people Warren certainly has expertise in domestic economic policy but she s been beefing up her foreign policy credentials as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee Last fall before officially declaring her candidacy Warren outlined in broad strokes her vision for a progressive foreign policy in an op ed in Foreign Affairs Among other goals Warren emphasized the importance of ensuring trade negotiations are used to curtail the power of multinational monopolies and crack down on tax havens of making honest assessments of the full costs and risks associated with going to war and of committing to reprioritize diplomacy and reinvest in the State Department and the development agencies She also criticized the Defense Department s bloated budget and called for pulling troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq In June she offered an unequivocal no when the New York Times asked whether American troops would still be in Afghanistan at the end of her first term in office Warren s housing plan is built around the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act which she initially introduced to the Senate in 2018 The bill would set aside 500 billion over the next 10 years to build preserve and rehab units that will be affordable to lower income families The increase in units would in turn drive down rental costs How would this be paid for you ask The same way Warren plans to pay for several of her proposals by taxing the rich Currently an heir doesn t pay estate taxes until they inherit 22 million or more Warren would reduce the threshold to 7 million which she says would fully pay for the plan Her plan would also level the playing field for communities of color The legacy of racist redlining practices still haunts Black and Brown communities It s wrong Yesterday at SheThePeople2020 I talked about my new housing plan that would level the playing field for communities of color pic twitter com dmx9wzHqIW Elizabeth Warren ewarren April 26 2019 Warren has said that America needs to come up with immigration policy that align s with our values In July she delivered by unveiling a sweeping plan that includes remaking ICE and Customs and Border Protection allowing more refugees into the United States ending the abuse of migrants and reducing detention and decriminalizing border crossings We already have the tools to effectively track and monitor individuals without shoving them into cages and camps along the border she wrote on Medium As President I ll issue guidance ensuring that detention is only used where it is actually necessary because an individual poses a flight or safety risk Warren declined to publicly state a position when Massachusetts considered whether to legalize weed in 2016 but now says she voted in favor of the ballot measure and supports nationwide legalization Warren has cited the racial disparities in marijuana arrests as a big reason to legalize the substance In 2018 Warren introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen Cory Gardner the The Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States STATES Act that would free states with legal pot from the threat of federal crackdowns Our criminal justice system is broken and right at the heart of that problem is race and we have to address this head on Warren said at a CNN town hall earlier this year Black Americans she said are more likely to be arrested arraigned taken to trial wrongfully convicted and given harsher sentences adding that it is a criminal justice system that is not only locking up too many people it is a criminal justice system that has a problem of race right at the heart of it and we need to call it out for what it is Warren has also talked about making sure quality legal representation is available to everyone regardless of their income called for getting rid of for profit private prisons She has also stressed the need to ensure Americans who serve time in prison are reintegrated into society In June Warren released a plan to ban private prisons stop contractors from marking up prices on commissary goods and install an independent Prison Conditions Monitor inside Department of Justice s Office of the Inspector General Our criminal justice system is broken and race is right at the center of what s wrong Black Americans are more likely to be arrested wrongfully convicted and serve longer sentences than white Americans It s time to end mass incarceration pic twitter com Sr4PReS9v7 Elizabeth Warren ewarren June 23 2019 Acknowledging that court attacks on choice are not stopping anytime soon Warren has issued a Congressional call to action to protect reproductive rights She proposes ending the Hyde Amendment which makes it difficult for women who get their health coverage through Medicaid the VA or the Indian Health Service to pay for an abortion and for federal laws that would enshrine the protections of Roe v Wade no matter what state you live in In the same proposal she calls for repealing the Trump administration s gag rule that bars certain physicians from discussing abortion with their patients and for an increase in funding for Title X the federal government s family planning programs In June Warren released a plan to fortify federal elections which she wrote on Medium should be as secure as Fort Knox The plan calls for modernizing election machines blanket federal standards including same day registration early voting and vote by mail rather than the current state by state regulations measures to end gerrymandering and making Election Day a national holiday Prior to an early August blitz through Iowa Warren released a plan to invest in rural America The plan calls for increased government investment in rural communities including creating a public option for broadband strengthening health care and economic security and in true Warren fashion breaking up the agribusiness corporations that have been crippling smaller farmers for years Our failure to invest in rural areas is holding back millions of families weakening our economy and undermining our efforts to combat climate change Warren wrote It s time to fix this Warren supports abolishing the Electoral College which she argued in March encourages candidates to zero in on just a few battleground states and they don t get to hear about the issues that are on the top of people s minds everywhere else in the country She added Everyone s vote should count equally in every election no matter where they live The conversation about adding justices to the Supreme Court is a conversation that s worth having Warren told Politico earlier this year In the same conversation she floated the idea of bringing appellate judges onto Supreme Court cases It s not just about expansion it s about depoliticizing the Supreme Court Warren supports offering reparations to black Americans in recognition of the economic toll of slavery We must confront the dark history of slavery and government sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences including undermining the ability of Black families to build wealth in America for generations she said in a statement to Reuters But the form those reparations would take is somewhat unclear for instance it could take the form of legislation that guarantees a down payment on a house she s introduced a bill proposing exactly that in the past or something like her proposed Small Business Equity Fund which would offer grants to help black owned businesses get off the ground Warren introduced the Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act in June Among other provisions it would ensure that no family pays more than seven percent of their income for child care create a federally funded network of child care centers and guarantee day care workers were paid on par with public school teachers Biden does not support Medicare for All instead favoring an expansion of the Affordable Care Act In July he unveiled a health care plan built around subsidizing the big fucking deal he helped pass as Obama s vice president Biden s 2020 plan would also offer a Medicare like public option that Americans would be able to buy into I believe we have to protect and build on Obamacare Biden said in a video announcing the plan That s why I proposed adding a public option to Obamacare as the best way to lower cost and cover everyone I understand the appeal of Medicare for All but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare and I m not for that Biden s claim that Medicare for All would mean the end of the Obamacare is an odd way to promote his plan While true that Medicare for All would replace and thus end the ACA no one would lose coverage under a single payer system Biden has pledged to close 1 6 trillion in tax loopholes One staple of his stump speech is pledging to eliminate the stepped up basis loophole which allows heirs to pay less in taxes on their inheritance Biden also wants to crack down on the use of non compete clauses that make it difficult for workers to change jobs and has slammed the Trump tax cuts by saying that the vast majority of the benefits go to folks at the top and corporations But he has faced criticism for pointedly refusing to take aim at America s new oligarchs a la Warren or Sanders I love Bernie but I m not Bernie Sanders he said earlier this year I don t think 500 billionaires are the reason why we re in trouble At a recent Manhattan fundraiser he vowed not to demonize the wealthy if elected president and told the well heeled donors in attendance I need you very badly Biden who introduced one of the Senate s first climate bills in 1986 has endorsed the framework of a Green New Deal and unveiled a 1 7 trillion plan to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 The plan calls for signing climate focused executive orders on Biden s first day as president recommitting to the Paris climate accord reinforcing the Clean Air Act to combat growing transportation sector emissions and demanding Congress pass legislation creating an enforcement mechanism to meet emissions targets among other goals Biden also wants to use the reach and buying power of the federal government to combat climate change mandating that federal infrastructure spending help reduce pollution and all federal permitting decisions weigh the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change Biden s first major policy rollout focused on K 12 education The centerpiece of that plan is tripling Title I federal spending on schools that serve low income students from 16 billion to 48 billion He also wants to increase teacher pay expand pre K access for three and four year olds and invest more in mental health services in public schools If he s president he ll call on the Department of Education to fund efforts to diversify public schools But school desegregation is a dicey subject for Biden Before he got in the race the Washington Post highlighted Biden s opposition three decades ago to busing as a way to diversify public schools I do not buy the concept popular in the 60s which said We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers In order to even the score we must now give the black man a head start or even hold the white man back to even the race he told a Delaware newspaper in 1975 I don t buy that Biden has disavowed Super PACs and fossil fuel money but not corporate PAC money or dark money nonprofit groups His campaign has reportedly begun recruiting big money fundraisers a k a bundlers who receive nicknames depending on how much money they raise 50 000 for a Protector 100 000 for a Unifier After eight years as vice president Biden has logged more miles as a statesman than any other 2020 candidate His views are decidedly mainstream and centrist for good and ill He has slammed Trump s need to coddle autocrats and dictators and called for more support of NATO and a strong response to Russia s sustained assault on Western democracy including in the U S Yet he also voted for the Iraq war and supported President Obama s escalation of the war in Afghanistan In July he reset his approach to foreign policy for his latest run at the White House While speaking at the City University of New York Biden preached the need to restore America s relationship with the international community to what it was before the current president took office He promised to rejoin the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal cancel Trump s travel ban on predominantly Muslim nations resume sending aid to Northern Triangle nations and more Donald Trump s brand of America First has too often left America alone he said We only have one opportunity to reset our democracy After Trump we have to be prepared to make the most of it In July Biden unveiled a plan aimed at revitalizing rural America The plan features a bevy of economic initiatives investment in clean energy solutions tripling funding to expand rural broadband access measure to improve access to health care in rural areas and more A healthy vibrant rural America is essential to the success of our country he wrote in introducing the plan Yet in small town after small town parents watch their kids and grandkids leave rural communities because there just is not enough opportunity for them at home For too many rural Americans a pathway to the middle class is out of reach if they stay in their rural communities As vice president in 2015 Biden called for four years of free public college going further than Obama s proposal for free two year community college Biden s campaign website pays lip service to the need for all Americans to obtain the skills and education to realize their full potential from pre K to college but he has not explicitly endorsed four years of free public college since joining the 2020 primary only free community college and has been facing criticism for votes he made as a senator that made it harder for borrowers to discharge student debt through bankruptcy A longtime gun control advocate Biden responded to a school shooting in May by listing various policies that could prevent future tragedies The idea we don t have universal background checks he told reporters the idea that we don t outlaw a number of the weapons I was able to get outlawed in the crime bill from large magazines and assault weapons and all that this is crazy In the past he pushed for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines as well as implementing universal background checks We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months but it s clear we need to Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check Ban the sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines Joe Biden JoeBiden June 7 2019 As president Biden s website says he would pursue a humane immigration policy that upholds our values strengthens our economy and secures our border He recently pledged not to deport veterans who aren t U S citizens As a senator he voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act to pay for 700 miles of wall construction on the U S Mexico border He played a key role in the Obama administration championing the cause of Dreamers or undocumented residents who were brought to the country when they were young Legalization advocates slammed Biden when he entered the race in April telling Rolling Stone that he had an abysmal record when it came to marijuana law reform As a senator he helped lead the charge in the 80s to ramp up the federal government s War on Drugs introducing the Comprehensive Narcotics Control Act of 1986 and calling for the creation of a drug czar He has not made many public statements on the subject in recent years but in 2014 told Time magazine that he still didn t support legalization In July Biden released a plan for criminal justice reform that calls for the decriminalization of marijuana for states to be allowed to legalize it as they see fit and for it to be downgraded to a Schedule II substance at the federal level Biden has yet to take a position on abolishing the Electoral College Biden has yet to take a position on adding justices to the Supreme Court In 1983 during a hearing on President Reagan s plans to replace members of a national civil rights commission Biden said FDR s court packing was totally within his right but in his view was a bonehead idea that put in question for an entire decade the independence of the most significant body in the United States Since launching his campaign Biden s had to answer for his criminal justice stance in the 80s and 90s including support for the 1994 Crime Bill and co sponsoring the 1988 Anti Drug Abuse Act which created mandatory minimum sentences that treated crack cocaine more harshly than cocaine and contributed to the disproportionate incarceration of people of color It was a big mistake he told a crowd in January We thought we were told by the experts that crack you never go back it was somehow fundamentally different It s not different But it s trapped an entire generation In July Biden unveiled a comprehensive plan for criminal justice reform It calls for abolishing the death penalty private prisons cash bail and mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes investing in reforming law enforcement and encouraging the Justice Department to hold police departments accountable for misconduct a 20 grant program to encourage states to reduce crime and incarceration and more Today too many people are incarcerated in the United States and too many of them are black and brown Biden wrote To build safe and healthy communities we need to rethink who we re sending to jail how we treat those in jail and how we help them get the health care education jobs and housing they need to successfully rejoin society after they serve their time Biden a Roman Catholic has said that he personally opposes abortion but because this conviction is based on his faith he has no right to impose those views on other people Accordingly he said in 2012 that the government doesn t have a right to tell women what to do with their bodies And a Biden spokesman told the New York Times in March that Biden supports the landmark Roe v Wade decision But as a senator in the early 80s Biden voted in favor of an amendment to allow states to overturn Roe a vote he described then as the single most difficult vote I ve cast as a U S senator In early June Biden s campaign confirmed that he still supported the Hyde Amendment which bans federal funds from being used for abortions except in cases of rape incest and if the life of the mother is at risk This put him in stark contrast to other Democratic candidates on this issue Days later he reversed course and said he no longer supports the measure Biden website includes a call to protect every American s vote to make it easier for people of all races and classes to vote and protect our elections from foreign interference On the campaign trail he s said that Republicans want to scale back voting rights and make it harder for people of color to exercise their right to vote You ve got Jim Crow sneaking back in he said You know what happens when you have an equal right to vote They lose Biden has yet to take a position He dismissed the idea of reparations in a 1975 interview that resurfaced in news reports before he entered the presidential race I don t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather Biden told a local newspaper I feel responsible for what the situation is today for the sins of my own generation And I ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago Sanders is the author of Medicare for All legislation in the Senate His bill would transform Medicare into cradle to grave insurance coverage for all American residents financed by taxes so there would be no fees at doctors offices emergency rooms or hospitals Over a decade the government would need to fund and administer a 32 trillion program but studies have suggested overall U S spending on health care could drop even as tens of millions gain coverage Here is the truth that the drug and insurance companies do not want you to know Sanders tweeted in May Expanding Medicare to everyone will save the American people money When Sanders the democratic socialist preaches revolution he is talking about wresting power and wealth from the billionaire class to create security and opportunity for working people and an economy that works for all Sanders is targeting the wealth of America s oligarchs and has proposed hiking the estate tax to 77 percent on the fortunes of the very wealthiest aiming to raise 2 2 trillion from the nation s 588 billionaires including 74 billion from the Koch brothers alone If the Koch brothers and the billionaire class hate my guts I welcome their hatred Sanders has long said It s a line he cribbed from FDR from whom he has also taken the idea of an Economic Bill of Rights calling for among other things the government to guarantee a decent paying job to everyone who can work A job guarantee will lower the crime rate improve mental health and create a stronger sense of community Sanders has said It will create a much healthier and happier America He s also been a longtime proponent of raising the federal minimum wage from 7 25 per hour a starvation wage to 15 per hour insisting It is not a radical idea to say a job should lift you out of poverty not keep you in it Sanders campaign has not released a detailed climate policy but he was a co sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution released by Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Sen Ed Markey an ambitious comprehensive approach to the climate crisis that encompasses not just getting to net zero carbon emissions but investing in job creation infrastructure and protecting the frontline communities hardest hit by climate change Sanders also appeared at a Green New Deal rally at Howard University in May Climate change is not a hoax but is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet he has said and we intend to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy and in the process create millions of good paying jobs Sanders rhetoric on foreign policy has often mirrored his domestic priorities condemning the power of corporate multinationals and oligarchic concentrations of wealth His record leans toward an anti interventionist stance he voted against the Iraq war and more recently did not support ousting Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro citing the U S s long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American countries adding we must not go down that road again Sanders has called for Congress to reclaim its power to declare war and in April invoked the War Powers Resolution to cut off U S support for the Saudi led war in Yemen We re not going to invest in never ending wars he has said To my mind there is no idea bigger more critical or more urgent than ending our endless wars pic twitter com iUZRDh7WLb Bernie Sanders BernieSanders June 5 2019 During a July interview with Pod Save America Sanders offered sharp criticisms of Israel under Benjamin Netanyahu and said that he would absolutely considering cutting American aid to Israel in order to force the nation to behave differently You have an extreme right wing government with many racist tendencies he said of the nation under Netanyahu adding that our policy cannot just be pro Israel pro Israel pro Israel it has got to be pro region working with all of the people all of the countries in that area Sanders has been slow to evolve on gun control He voted for the NRA backed 2005 bill that made most gun makers immune from accountability for misuse of their weapons sparking the reckless marketing of military style weapons During his 2016 campaign Sanders cited his concern for mom and pop gun shops to justify his vote In his announcement speech for his 2020 run Sanders sounded more like a conventional progressive I m running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country he said We need to take on the NRA expand background checks end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons Sanders pushed the call for free college to the fore in his 2016 campaign and continues to champion the policy in 2020 He has called for free public college tuition with the federal government covering 67 percent of this cost and states the remaining 33 percent His plan seeks to fully fund historically black colleges and universities financed by a transaction fee for Wall Street trades on stocks bonds and derivatives Sanders is proposing to use the same Wall Street tax to fund a debt jubilee wiping out all 1 6 trillion in outstanding student loans If we could bail out Wall Street we sure as hell can CancelStudentDebt he tweeted after announcing his new debt relief legislation in June Sanders supports the Marijuana Justice Act which would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act meaning it would no longer be federally prohibited and legality would be left up to the states The act would also invest at least 500 million a year in communities hardest hit by the Drug War and withhold federal Department of Justice funding from states that enforce their own pot laws unequally Nearly 7 in 10 Americans and a majority of both Republicans and Democrats support marijuana legalization The American people agree It is time our federal government listens We must end the criminalization of marijuana in this country Bernie Sanders BernieSanders April 19 2019 He ratcheted up his rhetoric on the issue during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience in August saying that if elected he would use an executive order to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I narcotics which also includes heroin That is insane he told Rogan Heroin is a killer drug You can argue the plusses and minuses of marijuana but marijuana ain t heroin So we have to end that and that s what I will do as president of the United States I believe we can do that through executive order and I will do that Sanders wants to reexamine the Electoral College It is hard to defend the current system in which one candidate receives 3 million votes less than his opponent but still becomes president he said Sanders has voiced support for reforming the Supreme Court perhaps by rotating on new justices from the appellate courts but he s concerned that conservatives could retaliate if progressives pack the court My worry is that the next time the Republicans are in power they will do the same thing So I think that is not the ultimate solution he said at the We The People summit Sanders voted for the 1994 Crime Bill placing him in company with Joe Biden Today he wants to end the drug war including by legalizing marijuana Sanders also seeks to end cash bail mandatory minimums private prisons and the death penalty Sanders who is not given to fiscal conservatism has balked at reparations for slavery telling The View I think that right now our job is to address the crises facing the American people in our communities And I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check He elaborated on his position during a July appearance on Black Coffee with Marc Lamont Hill My preferred solution Sanders said is focusing a very substantial amount of federal money on distressed communities in America which in most cases not all will be African American communities That means paying attention and rebuilding schools making sure the young people who are graduating high school are not falling through the cracks that they have the job training or the ability to go to college making sure there is decent housing and that the environment in those communities is adequate and making sure everybody has health care Bernie Sanders expressed support for economic policies that would disproportionately benefit vulnerable communities This seems to be how he understands and supports reparations pic twitter com 7h0FEe69tx Marc Lamont Hill marclamonthill July 11 2019 In addition to calling for universal pre K Sanders wants universal child care In a society with our resources it is unconscionable that we do not properly invest in our children from the very first stages of their lives he tweeted in February We need universal publicly funded childcare Sanders has been on the record as staunchly pro choice since 1972 when he was quoted in a Vermont newspaper saying It strikes me as incredible that politicians think that they have the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body He opposes the Hyde Amendment which prohibits federal spending on most abortions limiting access for women on Medicaid in particular Sanders seeks to re enfranchise people with felony records including those currently behind bars He d abolish Voter ID laws restore the Voting Rights Act create automatic voter registration at the federal level for all Americans over 18 and make Election Day a national holiday The great political crisis we face is not voter fraud which is virtually nonexistent he tweeted in April The crisis we face is voter suppression Our movement is about ending voter suppression restoring the Voting Rights Act and implementing automatic voter registration Sanders uses a Wall Street transaction tax to fund free college With Rep Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Sanders also has a proposal to cap all interest rates for credit cards and other consumer lenders at 15 percent 55 signatories just came out in favor of BernieSanders my joint call to cap ALL interest at 15 Supporters include the fmr Chief Economist of the World Bank private equity CEOs leading economists fmr members of Congress and more https t co FU28XYA4Ah Alexandria Ocasio Cortez AOC June 5 2019 Sanders speaks about immigration in more conservative terms than some 2020 competitors What we need is comprehensive immigration reform he said stumping in Iowa If you open the borders my God there s a lot of poverty in this world and you re going to have people from all over the world And I don t think that s something that we can do at this point Can t do it So that is not my position Sanders has long blasted free trade deals unfair trade agreements written by multi national corporations as harmful to the American working class and he calls for a trade policy that benefits American workers and creates living wage jobs He hits Trump as being feckless in slowing offshoring of jobs and closing the trade deficit He wants to close the tax breaks that provide incentives to ship jobs overseas Sanders also wants to expand buy American policies to increase job growth at home He would also make sure binding labor environmental and human rights standards are written into the core text of all trade agreements Buttigieg has said a single payer health care system is the right place for us to head as a country but doesn t think a Medicare for All model necessitates the elimination of the private insurance industry If we want to make Medicare available to everybody whether it s as a public option to buy in or simply establishing that as how the payer structure works in this country that s going to be the center of gravity he told ABC in February The bottom line is that we need to make sure every American is able to get health care Buttigieg has described his plan as Medicare for All Who Want It which would serve as a pathway toward Medicare for All Buttigieg has one of the field s most radical ideas for reforming the Supreme Court He told The Intercept in March that we definitely need to do structural reform on the Supreme Court and has floated the idea that the court should be expanded to 15 seats five of which would be left leaning five of which would be right leaning and five that would be chosen by a consensus of the other 10 The reform of not just expanding the number of members but doing it in a way where some of them are selected on a consensus nonpartisan basis it s a very promising way to do it Buttigieg told NBC News in June There may be others But the point is we ve got to get out of where we are now where any time there is an opening there is an apocalyptic ideological firefight It harms the court it harms the country and it leads to outcomes like we have right now Buttigieg has called for the end of the Electoral College At risk of sounding a little simplistic one thing I believe is that in an American presidential election the person who gets the most votes ought to be the person who wins he said at a CNN town hall in March Buttigieg bucked with some progressives in April when he seemed to oppose tuition free college while speaking to students at Northeastern University Americans who have a college degree earn more than Americans who don t As a progressive I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they did he said The previous month he told Vice that he believes there should be a comprehensive strategy but that he isn t wedded to any specific approach to tackling the student debt crisis such as debt cancelation In May he clarified his own strategy by releasing his higher education policy on his website His plan calls for debt free public college as well as an increase in Pell Grants and more support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions Buttigieg has also said he would expand the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program which as the name implies offers loan forgiveness in exchange for public service In June Buttigieg delivered a foreign policy focused speech at the Indiana University at Bloomington in which he laid out several proposals including repealing and replacing the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force AUMF which essentially gives the president unilateral authority to wage war and withholding taxpayer money from Israel if it annexes the West Bank Though he supports Israel Buttigieg noted that a supporter of Israel may also oppose the policies of the Israeli right wing government and that he is seeing increasingly disturbing signs that the Netanyahu government is turning away from peace The Afghanistan veteran has also called for an end to endless wars and criticized both parties for failing to develop an adequate approach to international relations Since the election of the current president the United States hardly has a foreign policy at all he said And lest that seem like a partisan jab I should acknowledge that for the better part of my lifetime it has been difficult to identify a consistent foreign policy in the Democratic Party either Pete Buttigieg on his recent speech on foreign policy I think that ever since the Iraq War it s been difficult for the Democratic Party to really feel out what we believe the limits the boundaries and the basis of foreign policy can be CNNSOTU pic twitter com xPE2Gi5e6u CNN Politics CNNPolitics June 16 2019 We need a strategy he added Not just to deal with individual threats rivalries and opportunities but to manage global trends that will define the balance of this half century in which my generation will live the majority of our lives We can quibble over marginal tax rate levels but we know that a lot of people in this country are not paying their fair share Buttigieg said on CBS in January We know about Warren Buffet paying less percent of taxes than his secretary and I think we know that s wrong There s this talk about this being some crazy left wing position but I think the idea that some people aren t paying their fair share and we ve got to change that that s something most Americans

telling Pod Save America that it s the right moment to have the conversation about universal basic income In July Buttigieg rolled out a plan for a new national service program that would build a network of one million national service participants by 2026 Dubbed A New Call to Service the plan would bolster existing programs like AmeriCrops and the Peace Corps as well as creating new similar

investment to build a 100 clean energy society Buttigieg supports automatic voter registration expanding early voting making Election Day a national holiday and restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated but at a CNN town hall in April he said that he didn t support people being allowed to vote while incarcerated Part of the punishment when you are convicted of a crime and you re incarcerated is you lose certain rights You lose your freedom he said And I think during that period it does not make sense to have an exception for the right to vote We shouldn t tolerate America becoming less democratic over our lifetimes HR1 would expand our rights as voters with much needed reforms like automatic voter registration and transparency on dark money Now the Senate must act to protect our democracy Pete Buttigieg PeteButtigieg March 8 2019 Buttigieg supports universal background checks and is a member of the bipartisan group Mayors Against Illegal Guns After the New Zealand

undocumented immigrants He has also called for comprehensive immigration reform that would end the backlogs in our lawful immigration and asylum processes The government s role should be to make sure all women have access to comprehensive affordable care and that includes preventive care contraceptive services prenatal and postpartum care and safe and legal abortion Buttigieg s website reads He also supports the repeal of the Hyde Amendment which restricts federal funding for abortion except in extreme cases such as rape and incest I believe that the right of a woman to make her own decisions about her reproductive health and about her body is a national right I believe it is an American freedom that should be enjoyed by women in every state The next president needs to be ready to protect those rights pic twitter com NM5IJkO9GO Pete Buttigieg PeteButtigieg May 20 2019 Buttigieg supports the legalization of marijuana and has said that he first learned about white male privilege when he was caught with a joint by a police officer in college but wasn t arrested for it A lot of people probably had the exact same experience and would not have slept in their own beds

Douglass this plan demands we take aggressive steps toward fulfilling long broken promises of true equality including reforming broken systems strengthening access to credit and injecting capital into the Black community Buttigieg tweeted If we don t tackle racial injustice in my lifetime it will upend the American Project in my lifetime If the Marshall Plan could rebuild Europe I believe the Douglass Plan could renew America At the National Action Network convention in April Buttigieg said he opposed solitary confinement As we work to end mandatory minimums for nonviolent offenses as we work to put an end to prolonged solitary confinement which is a form of torture here too we must be intentional about fixing disparities that have strong and deeply unfair racial consequences he said At the same conference he argued the death penalty should be abolished Speaking of sentencing disparities it is time to face the simple fact that capital punishment as seen in America has always been a discriminatory practice and we would be a fairer and safer country when we join the ranks of modern nations who have abolished the death penalty Buttigieg has also called for the elimination of the private prison industry reforming pre trial detention and cash bail and incentivizing the reduction of mass incarceration Buttigieg said in April that he is open to considering reparations The country as a whole is effectively segregated by race and the resources are different he said at the National Action Network convention There is a direct connection between exclusion in the past and exclusion in the present In July Harris unveiled her 2020 health care proposal in a Medium post titled My Plan for Medicare for All The plan calls for the expansion of the current Medicare system while allowing private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits Harris plan sets the U S on track to adopt a Medicare for All style system in 10 years a timeframe that has drawn criticism Even at the end of this 10 year transition period however the private insurance industry would not be eliminated This isn t about pursuing an ideology she wrote in the post announcing the plan It s about delivering for the American people The plans puts to rest months of confusion as to whether Harris who co sponsored Bernie Sanders 2017 Medicare for All bill supports the elimination of the private insurance industry During a CNN town hall in January Harris said let s eliminate all of that ostensibly in reference to private insurance In May she said the comment was actually in reference to all of the red tape in the health care system and that she does indeed support some private insurance to supplement a government plan She appeared to reverse course during the first Democratic debates in June when she was one of only two candidates onstage the other being Bernie Sanders to raise their hand when asked whether they supported the elimination of the private insurance industry But the next day she said on Morning Joe that she misheard the question from moderator Lester Holt clarifying once again that she does support some forms of private supplemental insurance It s now clear that unlike the author of the bill she supported in 2017 Harris does indeed want to retain the private insurance industry Though some progressives have proposed taxing the ultra wealthy Harris wants to focus on offering relief for the lower and middle classes She s unveiled a nearly 3 trillion plan that would provide a tax credit of 3 000 for single Americans making up to 30 000 annually and 6 000 for married couples making up to 60 000 Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can t keep up with cost of living increases she said when she unveiled the plan in the fall of 2018 We should put money back into the pockets of American families Not surprisingly Harris isn t a huge fan of Trump s 2017 tax bill which favored corporations and wealthy Americans to a disproportionate degree In May she called for a full repeal of the bill during a campaign stop in Michigan Get rid of the whole thing she said Harris has released what her website describes as the most aggressive equal pay proposal in history The plan calls for companies to obtain Equal Pay Certification which involves proving through various means that they are not giving preferential treatment to men over women in regard to pay promotions and more Companies that do not obtain an Equal Pay Certification will face a fine for every day they discriminate against their workers The larger the wage gap the larger the fine The plan would also involve overhauling anti discrimination laws It should not be on that working woman to prove it It should instead be on that large corporation to prove that they are paying people for equal work equally Kamala Harris says about her plan to fine companies that don t achieve pay equity https t co L7uzDkcu8U pic twitter com COg5VzAvZh CNN Politics CNNPolitics May 20 2019 Harris has a strong record on climate action including sponsoring a bill that would give grants to coastal

prisoners despite an overcrowding problem and supported the death penalty Harris has taken a more progressive stance since announcing her run for the White House In March she called for a federal moratorium on executions calling them immoral discriminatory ineffective and a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars A month later she expressed regret for the anti truancy program she instituted as DA At a She The People forum later in April Harris said she would absolutely pardon those convicted of drug related crimes We have to have the courage to recognize that there are a lot of folks who have been incarcerated who should not have been incarcerated and are still in prison because they were convicted under draconian laws that have incarcerated them she said In April Harris said that if Congress does not enact meaningful gun legislation within her first 100 days in office she would take executive action to bring about several gun control measures We need reasonable gun safety laws in this country starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban she said at a CNN town hall event but they have failed to have the courage to act The executive actions would require background checks of anyone buying guns from a dealer who sells more than five guns per year impose regulations on gun manufacturers and close the boyfriend loophole which allows some domestic abusers to purchase guns so long as they were not married to the victim In April Harris reintroduced to the Senate her Rent Relief Act a bill aimed at combating rising rent costs by offering a refundable tax credit to Americans making less than 100 000 a year who spending at least 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities Harris wasn t done there While speaking at the Essence

strike policies that permit eviction after a criminal incident with a review process prevent families from being evicted if a guest commits and infraction and more By requiring a higher standard of evidence and a more holistic review process we are taking a significant step toward giving Americans a fair chance to succeed Harris added Harris has criticized Trump s approach to foreign policy America s position in the world has never been weaker she said during her campaign kickoff event When democratic values are under attack around the globe when authoritarianism is on the march when nuclear proliferation is on the rise when we have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware The senator has come under scrutiny from the more progressive wing of the party for her cozy relationship with Israel and her failure to publicly condemn the nation s human rights abuses against Palestinians In March Harris reinforced her relationship with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC tweeting a picture of herself meeting with the organization s California leaders In April Harris wrote on Medium that she was co sponsoring the College For All Act which eliminates tuition and fees for public colleges and universities for 80 percent of Americans those earning less than 125 000 per year In July she tweeted that she ll establish a student loan debt forgiveness program for Pell Grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities The tweeted prompted widespread criticism for its narrow focus A day later Harris thanked people for their feedback and tried to clarify confusion about the proposal stressing that she ll also help close the opportunity gap through 12 billion in direct capital investments along with other measures detailed on her website Harris has said we should re examine the role of U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE suggesting that it could be time to scrap the agency She has been fiercely critical of Trump s family separation policy at the border and a vocal supporter of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program protecting undocumented residents who were brought to the country when they were young who are also known as Dreamers Harris has been criticized however for supporting a policy that turned over arrested undocumented youth to ICE when she was the San Francisco district attorney She has since said this was an unintended consequence of the 2008 policy and that she did not support that consequence of that policy This has been disputed In

Chairman Jerry Nadler Times have changed marijuana should not be a crime she said about the bill aimed at decriminalizing marijuana on a federal level We need to start regulating marijuana and expunge marijuana convictions from the records of millions of Americans so they can get on with their lives As marijuana becomes legal across the country we must make sure everyone especially communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs has a real opportunity to participate in this growing industry In May Harris unveiled a plan to institute what she calls the

surrounding the abolition of the Electoral College There s no question that the popular vote has been diminished in terms of making the final decision about who s the president of the United States

verge of a crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court she said We have to take this challenge head on and everything is on the table to do that Harris has called for the need to update and reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act and tweeted the need for legislation to expand early voting modernize voting systems and curb the effect of discriminatory voting laws Asked in April whether she supports allowing incarcerated Americans to vote the former prosecutor called the issue complex and said she d think about it Like many candidates Harris has said that the idea of reparations needs to be considered In March she spoke to NPR about the generational effects of slavery including how African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and high blood pressure suggesting reparations could come in the form of mental health treatment We need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done in terms of intervention to correct course she said Harris said during a CNN town hall event in January that she absolutely supports a nationwide paid parental leave policy Even more than that she added I support a national policy

is promoting universal basic income as a way to insulate America from the impending job loss and dislocation caused by automation and artificial intelligence As many as one third of current American jobs are vulnerable to being automated by 2030 Some progressives are troubled however by the fact that the Freedom Dividend is meant to displace traditional social welfare programs not add to them Beneficiaries would have to choose between their current food stamps or disability check and the 1 000 in monthly cash Paying for the Freedom Dividend is much easier than many think It would not cause

believe that Americans should have the option to remain their private insurance providers Gabbard has been stridently anti interventionist and believes the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Syria But her approach to foreign policy has gone beyond taking a strong anti war position She has bene widely criticized for visiting murderous Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad in 2017 on a secret fact finding mission while dismissing his opposition across the board as terrorists Gabbard has been fiercely critical of the Trump administration s approach to Iran particularly its decision to send troops to the Middle East in anticipation of a potential conflict and has called for the United States to re enter the Iran nuclear deal Iran war is HIGHLY likely unless Trump swallows his pride returns to the Iran nuclear agreement he tore up But I fear he won t put the interests of our country those who ll be killed in such a war ahead of his own pride personal political interests https t co CmC3DaSieK pic twitter com g7UE6TOmhZ Tulsi Gabbard TulsiGabbard June 14 2019 Gabbard s anti interventionism came to the fore during the opening night of the first Democratic debates in June when she sparred with Tim Ryan who argued that the United States needs to remain engaged in Afghanistan Is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan Well we just have to be engaged As a soldier I will tell you that answer is unacceptable Gabbard said Though she has not offered specifics Gabbard wrote in 2017 that there is no question our tax code needs serious reform before explaining why she voted against Trump s tax cut for the wealthy This bill isn t about real tax reform it s a giveaway to corporations and special interests on the backs of people who are already struggling just to make ends meet she wrote In 2017 Gabbard introduced the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act which aims to bring the United States to 100 percent reusable energy by 2035 For too long our nation has failed to take action on climate change putting the future of our people and our planet in danger she said of the bill the

There are reforms that need to take place to make it so that our votes are being cast and counted and represented in the outcome of our elections she said during a stop in New Hampshire in March I think there are pros and cons to the existing Electoral College and to getting rid of it Gabbard s telling CNN in January that she planned to run for president wasn t received quite as warmly as she may have hoped As soon as she declared her candidacy she was met with a flood of criticism for her past views regarding the LGBTQ community particularly relating to her work for the Alliance for Traditional Marriage which fought against gay rights in Hawaii Gabbard initially ran for office on her drive to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage in the state while working with the group She also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexual America and has objected to children being taught that homosexuality is normal She soon apologized later in January My views have changed significantly since then she said in a YouTube video going on to reference her congressional record My record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart a strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights Though Gabbard was anti abortion early in her career she has voted in favor of abortion rights on several occasions and currently has a 100 rating from Planned Parenthood Gabbard doesn t believe people on parole should be allowed to vote despite their ability to in Hawaii I m just realizing Tulsi Gabbard is the only Dem presidential

involves overturning Citizens United heightening transparency of Super PACs and other fundraising mechanisms including social media ads cracking down on campaign finance violations banning members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists requiring all presidential candidates to release their tax returns and more So much of what we got to get done from climate to health care to changing the tax code is going to require us to change the way our politics works Bennet said on a conference call in June Our plan responds to that by taking on the corruption in Washington and at the same time strengthening our democracy It attempts to take the money out of politics and put the American people back in Bennet does not support Medicare for All instead favoring an expansion of the Affordable Care Act called Medicare X Like other candidates who do not support a single payer health care system Bennet has warned that the the plan favored by progressives is not what it seems When you tell people the first thing about Medicare for All either that it takes insurance away from 180 million Americans that have it through their employer or the taxes we would have to pay to afford that 30 trillion program that 70 percent support falls to the mid 30s Bennet said on CNN in May I think we need to level with the American people Bennet even used his opposition to Medicare for All to solicit

as heart disease and diabetes are more prevalent in rural communities And the lack of providers and insurers has resulted in higher costs and lower quality of care Bennet has not proposed raising taxes on the wealthy but his American Family Act would greatly expand the child tax credit which currently provides up to 2 000 per child up to the age of 17 This plan would benefit lower class and middle class families with children and according to Vox could cut poverty in the United States by over a third Bennet has not released a higher education plan but his campaign told the New York Times that he wants to make sure college students can pursue their studies without incurring the crushing burden of debt more people seeking an alternative to college can pursue high quality apprenticeships and job training and Americans throughout their lives can advance their careers by improving their existing job skills or learning new ones A former superintendent of the Denver public school system Bennet has also promised to ensure all children are able to receive high quality education beginning in early childhood Bennet believes the Electoral College should be abolished The electoral college is outdated one of his Facebook ads reads Americans should directly elect our presidents Bennet does not believe in adding justice to the Supreme Court and has argued that amending the court in response to what has transpired during Trump s presidency would be stooping to the level of Republicans Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the tea party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell have been the last thing I want to do is be those guys Bennet told the Washington Post in March What I want to do is beat these guys so that we can begin to govern again

influence our elections if they want to do business with the largest contractor in the nation the federal government He has also pledged to empower watchdog agencies go after groups that seek to corrupt our elections ban Super PACs pass the Disclose Act and work to overturn Citizens United When he was asked last year in New Hampshire whether he supported Medicare for All Bullock said that health care ought to be affordable accessibly and of quality How we get there there s any number of different paths 400 of the richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 60 of people Bullock tweeted in June At the same time the average worker hasn t had a real wage increase in 40 years Every American deserves a fair shot at success not just the wealthy Bullock does not support the Green New Deal telling the Washington Post that we can do better with a more focused plan and that we should significantly increase renewable energy reverse the Trump Administration s cuts to fuel efficiency standards and expand them to address the 37 of emissions that come from transportation improve energy efficiency which could account for 30 of our overall goal and follow the IPCC s

upending something that s been around since the start of our country I d rather turn around and say why is it that we re not winning in certain places he said while campaigning in Iowa I would much rather say why aren t we winning in places like Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan Iowa Bullock has said that he is willing to considering various types of Supreme Court reform including imposing term limits and adding justices I m open to trying to say how can we actually make sure that that court isn t reflective of politics he told the New York Times in June I begin from the premise that a woman should be able to make her own health decisions in consultation with her doctor if she chooses her family and faith Bullock told the Washington Post in May adding that the restrictive bills passed in Alabama and Missouri not only an attack on Alabama but an attack on women having domain in over their body Though Delaney writes on his website that he believes healthcare is a fundamental right and

proposed a national service program for young people graduating from high school The plan would aim to enroll 200 000 high school graduates in the first year of the program which would provide incentives to work on various building and infrastructure projects managed by both nonprofit and for profit companies Delaney does not support the idea of a wealth tax a la that of Elizabeth Warren and has even argued that it might not be constitutional Instead he has proposed raising the tax rate on capital gains and matching it with the normal income tax rate What I d like to do is reform the

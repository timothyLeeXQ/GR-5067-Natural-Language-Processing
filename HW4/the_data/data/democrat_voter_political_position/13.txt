Party which was founded in 1792 in opposition to George Washington s Federalist Party Thomas Jefferson was an early leader of the Democratic Republicans and the party s first president Support for the Federalist Party waned following the War of 1812 ushering in a period of uncontested Democratic Republican rule After the presidential election of 1824 pit four Democratic Republican candidates against one another the party split as members coalesced around winner John Quincy Adams or runner up Andrew Jackson The former group established the short lived National Republican Party a forerunner to the Whig Party and eventually the modern Republican Party The latter group became known as Jacksonian Democrats before shortening their name to the Democratic Party formally adopting the title in 1844 7 The Democratic Party is represented by the donkey dating to Adams supporters calling Andrew Jackson a jackass in the 1828 presidential election Jackson embraced the name even including a donkey on campaign posters Political cartoonist Thomas Nast began using the donkey to represent the Democratic Party as a whole in the 1870s 8 In the 1840s and 1850s the Democratic Party experienced conflict over the question of extending slavery to the Western territories The unresolved dispute caused the party to split in the 1860 presidential election The party s fracture set the stage for the election of the first Republican president Abraham Lincoln Bitterness over the Civil War and post war Reconstruction motivated Southern states to primarily support the Democratic Party for the next 100 years during which time they wielded considerable control over the party 9 By the 1900s the Democratic Party had evolved from its original platform and began to favor more government oversight and regulation in business and economic affairs The progressive policies of the Wilson administration initiated the transition which deepened with the establishment of various social assistance programs after the Great Depression During this period the Democratic Party began to embrace a more liberal interpretation of the United States Constitution 10 Religious affiliation also contributed to the evolution of the Democratic Party Republicans were primarily Presbyterian Methodist and Congregationalist while most Democrats were Catholic Episcopalian and German Lutheran Because of this sharp division issues like prohibition became difficult to negotiate Republicans believed that the government should be involved in moral issues such as alcohol consumption while Democrats felt that the government should not make religious or moral legislation 10 The website for the Democratic National Committee DNC lists the following historical timeline for the Democratic Party 11 For more than 200 years our party has led the fight for civil rights health care Social Security workers rights and women s rights We are the party of Barack Obama John F Kennedy FDR and the countless everyday Americans who work each day to build a more perfect union We ve reined in a financial system that was out of control and delivered the toughest consumer protections ever enacted We ve reworked our student loan system to make higher education more affordable and won the fight for equal pay for women We passed the Recovery Act which created or helped to save millions of jobs and made unprecedented investments in the major pillars of our country From America s beginnings to today people have turned to Democrats to meet our country s most pressing challenges and pave the way for a future that lifts up all Americans 1920s 19th Amendment Woman s Suffrage Under the leadership of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson the U S Constitution was amended to grant women the right to vote On August 18 1920 Tennessee s became the 36th state to ratify women s suffrage and it became our nation s 19th amendment 1930s In the 1930s Americans turned to Democrats and elected President Franklin Roosevelt to end the Great Depression President Roosevelt offered Americans a New Deal that put people back to work stabilized farm prices and brought electricity to rural homes and communities Under President Roosevelt Social Security established a promise that lasts to this day growing old would never again mean growing poor 1935 Social Security Act One of the most enduring parts of FDR s New Deal the Social Security Act provides assistance to retirees the unemployed widows and orphans By signing this act FDR was the first president to advocate for federal assistance for the elderly It was largely opposed by Republican legislators 1944 In 1944 FDR signed the G I Bill a historic measure that provided unprecedented benefits for soldiers returning from World War II including low cost mortgages loans to start a business and tuition and living expenses for those seeking higher education Harry Truman helped rebuild Europe after World War II with the Marshall Plan and oversaw the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization By integrating the military President Truman helped to bring down barriers of race and gender and pave the way the way for civil rights advancements in the years that followed 1960s In the 1960s Americans again turned to Democrats and elected President John Kennedy to tackle the challenges of a new era President Kennedy dared Americans to put a man on the moon created the Peace Corps and negotiated a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons And after President Kennedy s assassination Americans looked to President Lyndon Johnson who offered a new vision of a Great Society and signed into law the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act 1964 Civil Rights Act This landmark piece of legislation outlawed major forms of discrimination against African Americans and women and prohibited racial segregation Signed into law by President Lyndon B Johnson it ended unequal voting requirements and segregated schools workplaces and public facilities Medicare President Johnson s enactment of Medicare was a watershed moment in America s history that redefined our country s commitment to our seniors offering a new promise that all Americans have the right to a healthy retirement 1976 In 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal Americans elected Jimmy Carter to restore dignity to the White House He created the Departments of Education and Energy and helped to forge a lasting peace between Israel and Egypt 1992 In 1992 after 12 years of Republican presidents record budget deficits and high unemployment Americans turned to Democrats once again and elected Bill Clinton to get America moving again President Clinton balanced the budget helped the economy add 23 million new jobs and oversaw the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in history 2008 And in 2008 Americans turned to Democrats and elected President Obama to reverse our country s slide into the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression and undo eight years of policies that favored the few over the many Under President Obama s direction and congressional Democrats leadership we ve reformed a health care system that was broken and extended health insurance to 32 million Americans 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act After decades of trying and despite unanimous opposition from Republicans President

No matter who you are who you love where you re from or how you worship Democrats are fighting for you 19 Democrats have long valued education as the key to success both for individuals and for our nation In 1944 Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the G I Bill a landmark piece of legislation that provided World War II veterans with opportunities for higher education The G I Bill helped create the modern middle class in America And in 1965 Lyndon B Johnson and a Democratic Congress enacted the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with the goal of providing a quality education to every child In recent years Democrats have further increased access to higher education and restructured and dramatically expanded college financial aid while making federal programs simpler more reliable and more efficient for students In 2010 President Obama signed into law student loan reform that cut out the role of big banks The Obama administration also doubled our investment in Pell Grants and made it easier for students to pay back student loans President Obama has worked to reform the higher education system and invested the most in student aid since the G I Bill Democrats are committed to protecting that progress because affordable public education is the foundation of our middle class Democrats want every child no matter their zip code to have access to a quality public K 12 education and for college to be affordable for every American We know that as the global marketplace grows more competitive we need to expand opportunities for higher education and job training Democrats are committed to increasing the college completion rate as well as the share of students who are prepared for budding industries with specific job related skills Democrats recognize education as the most pressing economic issue in America s future and we cannot allow our country to fall behind in a global economy We must prepare the next generation for success in college and the workforce 20 Here s what Democrats and President Obama have done Democrats want to protect and build on President Obama s progress They know that climate change is one of our nation s greatest challenges and that addressing this urgent threat could make America the world s clean energy superpower and create millions of good paying jobs Democrats will fight to protect the Paris Agreement to protect our planet for future generations Donald Trump on the other hand has called climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese a belief that not only flies in the face of scientific evidence but threatens the long term health and safety of our country It will take all of us acting together workers and entrepreneurs scientists and citizens the public and the private sector to address the challenge of climate change and seize our clean energy future 21 For decades Democrats have fought for the simple idea that everyone should have some basic security in health care When President Johnson signed Medicare into law in 1965 we were finally able to provide that security to America s seniors In 1997 Democrats passed the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP which currently covers 8 million kids But it took nearly a century to extend that basic measure of security to all Americans In 2010 despite unanimous opposition from Republicans Democrats were finally able to pass comprehensive health reform into law Thanks to the Affordable Care Act more than 20 million Americans have gained health care coverage and the uninsured rate has been cut almost in half Among the newly insured are more than 2 3 million young adults who are covered because the Affordable Care Act allows them to stay on their parent s insurance until age 26 Discrimination based on pre existing conditions is now illegal and nearly 8 in 10 Americans who recently shopped for health insurance in the marketplace could get it for less than 100 per month The Affordable Care Act has also allowed states to expand Medicaid to help even more Americans get covered Thirty one states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid and Medicaid and SCHIP enrollment has risen 26 percent The Affordable Care Act also provides tax credits to small businesses to help offset the costs of employee coverage and tax credits to help families pay for insurance We are also experiencing health care spending growth at its lowest level in 50 years Democrats are committed to preserving and protecting the Affordable Care Act and the peace of mind it has brought to millions of Americans and they will fight all attempts by the Trump administration to repeal the law and take health care away from tens of millions of Americans We are proud of this progress we have already made and are will work to extend and preserve it for generations to come 22 Thanks to President Obama hundreds of thousands of DREAMers have been able to receive a temporary status that allows them to study work pay taxes and contribute to the communities they grew up in His administration has made a tremendous difference by prioritizing immigration enforcement so that it is focused on those with criminal records and doesn t arbitrarily separate families and Democrats are fighting to protect that progress Democrats will continue to work toward comprehensive immigration reform that fixes our nation s broken immigration system improves border security prioritizes enforcement so we are targeting criminals not families keeps families together and strengthens our economy Democrats know the importance of our country s history as a nation of immigrants We honor our fundamental values by treating all people who come to the United States with dignity and respect and we always seek to embrace not to to attack immigrants 23 Democrats believe that our economy should strengthen our country and work for every American not just those at the top We are committed to helping all Americans meet the challenges of the 21st century by spurring job creation rebuilding our infrastructure investing in clean energy technologies and small businesses and making sure corporations the wealthy and Wall Street pay their fair share When President Obama took office in 2009 he inherited an economy in freefall with huge deficits skyrocketing health care costs dwindling employment and banking and housing markets on the brink of collapse Working with the President Democrats stabilized the financial system helped to prevent a second Great Depression and created millions of new jobs Democrats cut taxes for working families provided help for small businesses and homeowners and strengthened consumer protections Despite Republican obstruction at almost every turn Democrats provided relief for hardworking Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own Now we re working to protect that progress and fighting to extend it to every American who has been left behind When Republicans cut taxes for the wealthy but not the middle class or threaten our recovery with dangerous financial policies Democrats will fight back We want to guarantee that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed and that all working families can enjoy economic security Democrats won t be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job By making debt free college available to all Americans cracking down on companies that ship profits and jobs overseas fighting for equal pay and paid leave and ensuring the wealthiest citizens and largest corporations pay their fair share Democrats will never stop fighting to build an economy works for all 24 Defending America is not just a question of defending our borders We must continue to support and train our military to meet the challenges of 21st century threats That s why Democrats have made modernizing our military a top priority while also eliminating outdated programs and unnecessary spending Democrats are focused on preventing terrorism across the globe This means continuing to invest heavily in intelligence and information sharing and promoting those networks among our allies We have strengthened our ability to keep nuclear and biological weapons out of the hands of terrorists promoted efforts to better ensure border security and augmented defense of our national infrastructure President Obama made significant steps to keep America safe and restore America s image around the world by rebuilding strategic alliances with countries that share our values and face common threats Democrats will continue to build on and protect that progress 25 In the past government investments in scientific research have yielded innovations that have helped shape the landscape of American life technologies like the internet digital photography Global Positioning System technology laser surgery and cancer treatment But over the past three decades support for the physical mathematical and engineering sciences has been drastically cut at a time when other countries are substantially increasing their own research budgets Democrats believe that scientific research should play an important role in advancing science and technology in the classroom and in the lab In order to compete globally our next generation must be equipped with the tools and skills that lead to the job creating technological innovations and scientific breakthroughs of the future Democrats have taken significant steps to expand educational opportunities and make college more affordable for all Americans while improving the quality of our schools and our teachers Democrats have made historic investments in research for clean energy technologies that are helping to create the industries of the future The Obama administration lifted federal restrictions on stem cell research providing scientists and doctors with new resources to help save lives Democrats are working to close the digital divide expanding access to high speed broadband internet We recognize that broadband is an important addition to our national infrastructure by expanding access to information and education while serving as a central resource for small businesses and entrepreneurs to generate economic growth The Obama administration took unprecedented steps to use technology as an instrument to restore faith transparency and accountability to government and Democrats are fighting to protect his work so we can harness the ingenuity and experience of all Americans to increase efficiency and effectiveness of government 26 In 1935 Democrats and President Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security In 1965 Democrats and President Lyndon Johnson created Medicare Ever since Democrats have continually fought to defend these cornerstones of the American Dream in the face of attempts to dismantle or undermine both PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY For 75 years Social Security has been an enduring promise to America s seniors Today it remains a safety net for seniors and offers all Americans peace of mind In recent years Democrats have beaten back Republican plans to privatize Social Security plans that would have exposed the retirement funds of millions of American seniors to great risk on the eve of the financial crisis Instead no one lost a penny of Social Security STRENGTHENING MEDICARE Medicare is the second pillar of Democrats commitment to Americans retirement security Health care reform strengthened the Medicare trust fund expanding its life by more than a decade The Affordable Care Act has also improved care across the board reduced fraud and finally closed the hole in Medicare drug coverage known as the donut hole Seniors will continue to have full access to their doctors and are now eligible for free coverage for certain preventive services including an annual wellness exam HELPING AMERICANS SAVE FOR RETIREMENT Democrats are committed to making it easier for Americans to save for retirement on their own Nearly half the workforce about 75 million people currently do not have employer supported retirement plans Democrats want to make it easier for all Americans to participate in retirement accounts at work and support a system where employees have pension portability so workers don t lose their pension if they change jobs Democrats believe that all Americans have the right to a secure and healthy retirement and we will continue fighting to preserve both Medicare and Social Security for future generations 27 The right to vote is fundamental it is the right that protects and expands all other rights That s why the Democratic Party has continuously remained dedicated to making it easier and more convenient for Americans of all backgrounds to cast their ballot We adopted the boldest and most pro voter platform in history calling for expanding early voting and vote by mail implementing universal automatic voter registration and same day voter registration ending partisan and racial gerrymandering and making Election Day a national holiday We do this by supporting candidates for state secretary of state and state legislative seats who want to expand voting rights And we do this by supporting efforts in all 50 states to ensure that every eligible citizen can register and vote and that each vote is accurately counted This work is all the more important in the face of a cynical Republican strategy to make it more difficult to ordinary Americans to vote In the wake of the Supreme Court gutting a key provision of the Voting Rights Act 14 states passed or implemented some form of voting restriction These actions included eliminating same day registration reducing early voting prohibiting out of precinct voting and imposing strict photo ID laws During this same time period however 37 states passed election laws or regulations expanding access to the ballot box such as automatic registration online voter registration same day registration expanding early voting expanding accepted forms of identification or improving data through partnerships such as Pew s ERIC program ACHIEVEMENTS It is important to stop and recognize these achievements because they represent the culmination of years of advocacy and coalition building by our party leaders elected officials and core constituents CHALLENGES The 2016 election was the first in in 50 years without the full protection of the Voting Rights Act and 14 states had brand new voting restrictions put in place for this presidential election Republicans passed laws eliminating same day registration reducing early voting periods eliminating pre registration not counting certain provisional ballots and imposing a new voter ID law in states like Alabama Arizona Indiana Georgia Mississippi Nebraska North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Tennessee Texas Virginia and Wisconsin These laws have a real effect on our election outcomes and disproportionately affect women communities of color young people the elderly low income individuals and disabled voters as well as military members and veterans We saw this in Wisconsin where as many as 300 000 voters didn t have the photo ID that was required to vote The margin of victory in Wisconsin was only 23 000 votes We saw this again in North Carolina where there were 158 fewer early voting locations in 40 counties with large African American populations African American turnout in North Carolina was down 16 from 2012 As Republican politicians try to make it harder to vote Democrats are working to expand access to the polls Whether we are hitting the streets to register voters engaging with local election officials passing commonsense laws or taking our fights against discriminatory voting laws to court we won t stop working to promote a system of elections that is accessible open and fair As Congressman and Civil Rights leader John Lewis says the vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument in a democratic society We must use it 28 The 2016

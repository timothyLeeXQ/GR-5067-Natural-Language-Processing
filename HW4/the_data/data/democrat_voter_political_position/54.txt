WASHINGTON AP The sprawling Democratic presidential field is incredibly diverse but a new poll from The Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs finds Democrats give a collective shrug to gender race and age as factors they re considering when supporting a candidate Instead Democratic registered voters are yearning for experience in elected office A whopping 73 cited that as a quality that would make them more excited about supporting a presidential candidate Twenty five candidates are running for the party s nomination and include several women a Latino multiple candidates of African and Asian descent and a 37 year old gay man less than half the age of the 76 year old early front runner former Vice President Joe Biden But most Democratic voters say these characteristics make no difference in their enthusiasm the poll shows Benji Grajeda 50 of Santa Ana California was once excited at the idea that Hillary Clinton could become the first female president Now he just wants stability I don t think it matters gender said Grajeda who though he is Latino also said he wouldn t be any more motivated to back a Latino for president Instead Grajeda cited experience in office as his top priority because Trump has no experience I never really thought about it until he won he s just not qualified Grajeda said Four in 10 Democratic voters said they would be more excited about voting for a woman for president and 36 said the same of a younger candidate About a quarter were more excited at the idea of supporting a candidate who is black or Latino while roughly 2 in 10 said they d be more excited to support an Asian candidate or lesbian gay or bisexual candidate Still there are differences in enthusiasm among Democratic voters Liberal and younger Democrats are more likely to be excited about voting for a candidate who is black Latino or Asian and a candidate who is a woman And about half of Democratic women say they d be more excited to support a female candidate compared with 3 in 10 Democratic men who say the same Meanwhile about 8 in 10 Democratic voters say it wouldn t make any difference if a candidate were white or a man Charles G Cooper of Orlando Florida who is African American supports Biden who served under President Barack Obama I m an Obama guy and he was the vice president Cooper 57 said He s not worried about the demographic characteristics of the next president We re looking for a president who will unite the country Cooper said The poll also shows there s great potential for the debates Wednesday and Thursday to shake up the field because many voters have yet to fully tune in Two groups of 10 candidates will get a chance to take their messages directly to a national prime time audience from the stage in Miami Only 22 of Democrats registered to vote say they know a lot about the candidates positions while 62 say they know a little And only 35 say they re paying close attention to the campaign with almost two thirds saying they re paying some or no attention It s kind of a blur said Maggie Banks 32 of suburban Denver who has two young children and only has a chance to glean a few details about the race while listening to National Public Radio during her commute Banks said she has only a vague idea of who s running and didn t realize her state s senior senator Michael Bennet or former governor John Hickenlooper was in the race Voters like Banks comprise the vast majority of the Democratic electorate implying there s great potential for change in what s essentially been a static race to date Biden holds a solid but not dominant polling lead followed by some combination of Sens Bernie Sanders of Vermont Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Indiana Behind them are a wide range of contenders from Senate veterans like Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to lesser known candidates like internet entrepreneur Andrew Yang There s a large appetite for the campaign among Democratic voters 79 of whom say they re interested in the 2020 race Republicans are only slightly less interested with 70 reporting interest But only about 3 in 10 voters overall say they re paying close attention more than seven months before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses Adam Pratter 43 of San Diego is being strategic He has studied up on the five candidates leading in the polls but studiously ignored the rest Unless something extraordinary happens they re not going to make it Pratter said Pratter who is white is rooting for Buttigieg He d love to see a woman or person of color in the White House but he s nervous that voters will choose Trump again I m extraordinarily anxious he said That s common for Democrats 59 of whom report themselves anxious about the upcoming election in contrast with 34 of Republicans Kent Roberts a 71 year old handyman who lives in a Portland Oregon suburb is less stressed His favorite in the field is Harris though he likes several candidates He s eager for a woman or a minority to be the nominee He thinks those groups have to outperform white men to succeed If you re just a white bread guy you don t have to try as hard Roberts said Of potential path blazers like Harris who d be the first female African American president Roberts added They ll do better for our country if they re under slight pressure because they re not a white American ___ The AP NORC poll of 1 116 adults was conducted June 13 17 using a sample drawn from NORC s probability based AmeriSpeak Panel which is designed

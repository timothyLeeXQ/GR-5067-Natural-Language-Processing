becoming more distinct along demographic lines they are also becoming more polarized politically Americans in urban and rural communities have widely different views when it comes to social and political issues From feelings about President Donald Trump to views on immigration and same sex marriage there are wide gaps between urban and rural adults While these differences have been widely documented the survey finds that on some issues they can be attributed to differences in the partisan composition of urban suburban and rural areas rather than in viewpoints that are rooted in a particular type of community Rural areas tend to have a higher concentration of Republicans and Republican leaning independents while a majority of Americans in urban communities identify as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party These patterns have become more pronounced over the past two decades as rural areas have moved in a Republican direction and urban counties have become even more Democratic Americans who live in the suburbs are about evenly divided in their partisan loyalties and that has generally been the case in recent decades When it comes to abortion rights the significant gap in attitudes between urban and rural residents 61 of those in urban areas compared with 46 in rural areas say abortion should be legal in all or most cases virtually disappears after controlling for party Similar shares of Republicans in urban suburban and rural communities express this view as do nearly equivalent shares of Democrats in urban and rural communities A similar pattern can be seen on the question of whether the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests or if it is generally fair to most Americans Overall urban residents are more likely than those living in rural areas to say the economic system is unfair but that difference is not notable within party groups The same can be said of views on the country s changing demographics Across community types views are similar within the Republican and Democratic coalitions on the issue of nonwhites making up a majority of the population in the future despite differences among urban suburban and rural residents overall In some cases however differences across community types remain even after taking partisanship into account For example rural Republicans are more likely than Republicans living in urban areas to say the recent legalization of same sex marriage is a bad thing for the country Asked to rate President Trump on a feeling thermometer ranging from 0 to 100 a majority of Americans give Trump a very cold 51 or somewhat cool 8 rating while 10 rate him a neutral 50 on the 0 100 point thermometer By contrast 31 of Americans give him a very warm 22 or somewhat warm 9 rating Trump s ratings are particularly warm in rural areas where four in ten rate him warmly By contrast 19 of people in urban areas give Trump a warm rating These differences by community type remain even after controlling for party Among Republicans 56 of rural residents give Trump a very warm rating compared with 48 of suburban and 46 of urban Republicans Within the Republican coalition there are significant age gaps in views of Trump In the suburbs the share rating Trump very warmly is substantially higher among Republicans ages 50 and older 57 than among Republicans younger than 50 38 This gap persists among rural Republicans a group largely considered central to Trump s base Younger rural Republicans are less likely than their older counterparts to rate Trump very warmly 44 vs 66 Among Democrats community type differences are more modest 84 of suburban Democrats give President Trump a very cold rating compared with 78 of urban Democrats and 75 of rural Democrats And across community types age plays less of a role in Democrats views of Trump than among Republicans Similarly views of Barack Obama are divided by community type within parties 70 of Republicans in urban areas give Obama a cold rating compared with 78 of Republicans in rural areas And urban Democrats are more likely to give Obama a warm rating 83 than rural Democrats 72 On the issue of same sex marriage the parties have long been divided Still controlling for partisan differences the urban rural divide persists on this issue While 71 of rural Republicans say the legalization of same sex marriage is a bad thing for the U S Republicans in urban areas are significantly less likely to say the same 56 Among Democrats there is less of a distinction Urban and rural Democrats largely agree on the issue of same sex marriage 71 of urban Democrats and 67 of rural Democrats say it is a good thing Suburban Democrats have a somewhat more favorable view 78 say this is a good thing A similar pattern can be seen in views of societal priorities when it comes to marriage and family Respondents were asked which of the following statements came closer to their own views even if neither is exactly right Society is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority or society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children Among Republicans there is a wide gap by community type Urban Republicans are split with 53 saying society is just as well off if people have other priorities than marriage and kids and 45 saying society is better off if people prioritize marriage and kids By contrast majorities of rural 57 and suburban 60 Republicans say the latter As the immigrant share of the U S population nears a historic high Americans are largely divided by party and community type when it comes to views of immigrants Among Democrats those in urban 75 and suburban areas 81 are more likely than those in rural areas 65 to say the growing number of newcomers strengthens American society rather than threatening traditional American customs and values Differences on this question within the Republican coalition are more modest 78 of rural Republicans say the growing number of newcomers threatens traditional American customs and values This compares with 74 of suburban Republicans and 70 of urban Republicans Relatively few Republicans across community types say immigrants strengthen the country When asked about the impact immigrants are having on their own community a similar pattern emerges with Democrats divided across community types Among those who say there are at least a few immigrants in their local community 56 of urban Democrats say their impact is mostly positive compared with 43 of rural Democrats Overall urban and suburban residents are more likely than those living in rural areas to say there are immigrants living in their local community but even among rural residents the vast majority 79 say there are at least a few Depending on the type of community in which Americans live views differ sharply on whether white people in the U S benefit from advantages in society that black people do not have Americans living in rural areas are roughly evenly divided 52 say whites do not benefit too much or at all from advantages in society that black people do not have and 47 say they benefit a great deal or a fair amount By contrast three in ten people living in urban areas say whites do not benefit from societal advantages 69 say they do Overall the views of whites differ sharply from those of nonwhites on this issue 4 While about half 51 of whites say people in their racial group do not benefit from societal advantages just 22 of nonwhites agree The racial gap persists across all three community types White rural residents are twice as likely to say whites do not benefit from extra advantages 60 vs 30 Similarly there is a wide gap between the share of whites 49 and nonwhites 20 in suburban communities who say whites do not benefit from societal advantages Even so among nonwhites there is a divide between those living in urban and rural areas While 18 of nonwhites in urban areas say whites don t have extra advantages 30 of rural nonwhites say this When controlling for differences in partisanship across community types the racial divide persists on this issue Among Republicans living in suburban areas 72 of whites say that whites don t benefit from societal advantages compared with 52 of nonwhites a 20 percentage point gap And among suburban Democrats whites are 8 points more likely than nonwhites 19 vs 11 to say this Similarly there is a racial gap in views of demographic change in the U S Across all community types nonwhites are far more likely than whites to say it s a good thing for the country that nonwhites will make up a majority of the population in 25 to 30 years This pattern can also be seen in the suburbs where 14 of whites say this type of demographic change is good for the country compared with 46 of Hispanics and 56 of blacks A majority of suburban whites 64 say this demographic change is neither good nor bad for the country Millennials across urban suburban and rural areas are significantly more likely than Baby Boomers and members of the Silent Generation to say they think the legalization of same sex marriage is a good thing for society This difference is stark in the suburbs About seven in ten Millennials living in suburban areas 72 say the legalization of same sex marriage is a good thing Among Gen Xers as well a majority 59 say this is a good thing for society Boomers in suburban areas are more divided in views on same sex marriage About half 51 say it is a good thing for society Just one third of suburban Silents say this is a good thing These generational differences on same sex marriage remain even when controlling for differences in the partisan composition of each community Views of immigrants also differ widely by generation Roughly half 52 of Millennials in rural areas say the growing number of newcomers from other countries strengthens American society compared with 36 of Baby Boomers in rural areas and 32 of Silents who say the same This pattern is nearly identical across community types with Millennials in urban and suburban areas also more likely than Boomers and members of the Silent Generation to say newcomers strengthen society Majorities of Americans in all three community types say there are still significant obstacles that make it harder for women to get ahead than men Americans living in urban areas are somewhat more likely to say this is the case 60 than are those in suburban 55 and rural 53 areas However there is a significant gap between men and women on views about the obstacles women face to get ahead Women are far more likely than men to say significant obstacles still exist that make it harder for women to get ahead Two thirds of women compared with 46 of men say obstacles still exist And this gender gap is consistent across all types of communities For example 62 of rural women say they think obstacles still exist for women compared with 43 of rural men Even after controlling for party the gender gap persists across community types For example among Republicans in rural areas women are about twice as likely as men to say obstacles still exist that keep them from getting ahead 53 of rural Republican women vs 27 of rural Republican men Fact Tank01 17 2019 Fact Tank09 06 2018 Fact Tank11 28 2018 Internet Tech03 01 2018 Social Trends01

potential to alleviate the nation s rigid partisan divisions Yet the reality is that most independents are not all that independent politically And the small share of Americans who are truly independent less than 10 of the public has no partisan leaning stand out for their low level of interest in politics Among the public overall 38 describe themselves as independents while 31 are Democrats and 26 call themselves Republicans according to Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2018 These shares have changed only modestly in recent years but the proportion of independents is higher than it was from 2000 2008 when no more than about a third of the public identified as independents For more on partisan identification over time see the 2018 report Wide Gender Gap Growing Educational Divide in Voters Party Identification An overwhelming majority of independents 81 continue to lean toward either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party Among the public overall 17 are Democratic leaning independents while 13 lean toward the Republican Party Just 7 of Americans decline to lean toward a party a share that has changed little in recent years This is a long standing dynamic that has been the subject of past analyses both by Pew Research Center and others In their political attitudes and views of most issues independents who lean toward a party are in general agreement with those who affiliate with the same party For example Republican leaning independents are less supportive of Donald Trump than are Republican identifiers Still about 70 of GOP leaners approved of his job performance during his first two years in office Democratic leaners like Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of the president There are some issues on which partisan leaners especially those who lean toward the GOP differ substantially from partisans While a narrow majority of Republicans 54 opposed same sex marriage in 2017 nearly six in ten Republican leaning independents 58 favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally Yet independents who lean toward one of the two parties have a strong partisan imprint Majorities of Republican and Democratic leaners have a favorable opinion of their own party and they are almost as likely as Republican and Democratic identifiers to have an unfavorable opinion of the opposing party Independents stand out from partisans in several important ways They are less politically engaged than Republicans or Democrats and this is especially the case among independents who do not lean to a party In a survey conducted last fall shortly after the midterm elections partisan leaners were less likely than partisans to say they registered to vote and voted in the congressional elections About half of Democratic leaning independents 48 said they voted compared with 59 of Democrats The differences were comparable between GOP leaners 54 said they voted and Republicans 61 Those who do not lean toward a party a group that consistently expresses less interest in politics than partisan leaners were less likely to say they had registered to vote and much less likely to say they voted In fact just a third said they voted in the midterms In addition independents differ demographically from partisans Men constitute a majority 56 of independents That is higher than the share of men among Republican identifiers 51 are men and much higher than the share of men among Democrats just 40 Among independents men make up a sizable share 64 of Republican leaners and a smaller majority 55 of independents who do not lean Democratic leaners include roughly equal shares of men 51 and women 49 Independents also are younger on average than are partisans Fewer than half of independents 37 are ages 50 and older among those who identify as Democrats 48 are 50 and older as are a majority 54 of those who identify as Republicans Democratic leaning independents are younger than other independents or partisans Nearly a third 31 are younger than 30 compared with 21 of Republican leaning independents and just 19 and 14 respectively among those who identify as Democrats and Republicans As Pew Research Center reported last year Donald Trump s job approval rating during the early stage of his presidency is more polarized along partisan lines than any president in the past six decades In addition Trump s rating has been more stable than prior presidents During his first two years in office Trump s job rating among members of his own party was relatively high compared with recent presidents In 2017 85 of those who identify as Republicans approved of Trump s job performance based on an average of Pew Research Center surveys His job rating among Republicans was about as high 84 in 2018 Trump s early job rating among members of the opposing party 7 was much lower than those of three prior presidents Barack Obama George W Bush and Bill Clinton Trump s job rating among independents for his first two years in office also was lower than his recent predecessors his average job rating among independents was 34 in both 2017 and 2018 Obama s average rating was 50 during his first year 2009 it fell to 42 in his second year Trump s early rating among independents is closest to Clinton s whose job approval averaged about 42 during his first two years in office Bush whose overall job rating approached 90 in his first year following the 9 11 terrorist attacks had approval ratings above 60 among independents in his first two years Trump s job rating among independents like his overall rating breaks down along partisan lines His rating among GOP leaning independents 72 in 2017 69 in 2018 was not markedly different from Obama s and Clinton s ratings among Democratic leaning independents during their first two years in office though much lower than Bush s among Republican leaners Yet Trump s rating among independents who lean to the opposing party like his rating among members of the opposing party was much lower than recent presidents In fact his rating among Democratic leaning independents during his first two years was about as low as his rating among Democrats 7 in 2017 9 in 2018 Trump s rating also was low among independents who have no partisan leanings Only about a quarter of non leaners approved of Trump s job performance during his first two years while about six in ten 58 disapproved On most issues independents attitudes mirror the views of the overall public Independents who lean toward a party are usually on the same side as those who identify with the same party but the level of agreement between leaners and partisans varies depending on the issue By a wide margin 62 to 36 independents oppose Trump s signature policy proposal an expansion of the U S Mexico border wall Democratic leaning independents overwhelmingly oppose the border wall 95 disapprove as do Democratic identifiers 92 Republican leaning independents favor expanding the border wall though by a smaller margin than Republicans identifiers GOP leaners favor substantially expanding the wall along the U S Mexico border by roughly three to one 75 to 23 Among those who affiliate with the Republican Party the margin is nearly eight to one 87 to 11 Independents also have a negative view of increased tariffs between the U S and its trading partners 53 say they will be bad for the U S 36 good for the U S Independents views on the 2017 tax bill are more divided 34 approve of the tax law and 43 disapprove As with the border wall Democratic leaning independents are more likely to view increased tariffs negatively 75 say they will be bad for the U S than Republican leaning independents are to view them positively 66 say they will be good On taxes two thirds of GOP leaners approve of the tax law while an identical share of Democratic leaners disapprove Overall independents are divided in preferences about the size of government and views about government regulation of business Republican leaning independents largely prefer a smaller government providing fewer services 78 favor smaller government compared with just 17 who favor bigger government with more services The views of GOP leaners are nearly identical to the opinions of those who affiliate with the GOP 74 prefer smaller government Like Democrats most Democratic leaning independents prefer bigger government Democrats and Democratic leaners are in sync in opinions about whether the nation s economic system is generally fair But there are sharper differences in the views of Republicans and GOP leaners A 63 majority of those who identify as Republicans say the U S economic system is fair to most Americans fewer than half as many 29 say the system unfairly favors powerful interests GOP leaners are divided 49 say the system is generally fair while nearly as many 46 say it unfairly favors powerful interests Large majorities of both Democrats 85 and Democratic leaners 81 say the U S economic system unfairly favors powerful interests Most independents who do not lean toward a party share this view 70 Majorities of independents say the U S needs to continue to make changes to give blacks equal rights with whites 57 and that significant obstacles still make it harder for women to get ahead 54 In addition far more independents say immigrants do more to strengthen 66 than burden 23 the country In views of racial equality and women s progress the views of partisan leaners are comparable to those of partisans Large majorities of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the U S needs to make more changes to give blacks equal rights and that significant obstacles stand in the way of women Most Republicans and Republican leaners say the country has made needed changes to give blacks equal rights with whites and that the obstacles blocking women s progress are largely gone However Republican leaning independents differ from Republicans in their views of immigrants impact on the country Among GOP leaners 44 say immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents 40 say they are a burden on the country because they take jobs housing and health care A majority of those who identify as Republicans 55 say immigrants burden the country Views of immigrants impact on the country are largely positive among Democratic leaning independents 88 say they strengthen the U S and those who identify as Democrats 80 Public support for same sex marriage has grown rapidly over the past decade In June 2017 a majority of adults 62 favored allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally while just 32 were opposed Independents views of same sex marriage were similar to Democrats 73 of Democrats favored gay marriage as did 70 of independents Among those who identified as Republicans just 40 favored same sex marriage while 54 were opposed In contrast to Republicans Republican leaning independents favored same sex marriage 58 were in favor 37 were opposed Support for same sex marriage was higher among Democratic leaning independents than among Democrats 82 vs 73 Public support for legalizing marijuana use has followed a similar upward trajectory in recent years Currently 62 of the public says the use of marijuana should be made legal while 34 say it should be illegal Majorities of both Democrats 69 and independents 68 favor legalizing marijuana Republicans are divided with 45 supportive of legalization and 51 opposed Among GOP leaning independents a 60 majority favors legalizing marijuana And a large majority of Democratic leaning independents 75 also favors marijuana legalization Independents who do not lean to a party widely favored same sex marriage 65 favor this while 70 say the use of marijuana should be legal As in the past more independents describe their political views as moderate 43 than conservative 29 or liberal 24 These shares have changed little in recent years Since 2000 there have been sizable increases in the shares of both Republicans and Republican leaning independents who identify as conservative Today more Republican leaning independents describe themselves as conservatives 51 than as moderates 39 or liberals 8 In 2000 GOP leaners included almost identical shares of conservatives 42 and moderates 43 11 described their views as liberal Over the same period there has been growth in the shares of Democrats and Democratic leaners identifying as liberal Among Democratic leaning independents slightly more identify as moderates 45 than as liberals 39 while 14 are conservatives But the gap has narrowed since 2000 when moderates outnumbered liberals 50 to 30 By contrast moderates continue to make up the largest share of independents who do not lean to a party Nearly half of independents who do not lean to a party describe their views as moderate while 24 are conservatives and 18 are liberals These numbers have changed little since 2000 In a two party system it is not surprising that most Americans view their own party favorably while viewing the opposing party unfavorably Two thirds of Americans 66 view one party favorably while expressing an unfavorable opinion of the other party About one in five 17 feel unfavorably toward both parties while 12 feel favorably toward both The share of Americans who have a positive view of one party and a negative view of the other has increased since 2015 from 58 Over the same period there has been a decline in the share expressing a negative view of both parties from 23 in 2015 to 17 currently Independents who lean toward a party are less likely than partisans to view their party favorably In addition far more independents 28 than Republicans 10 or Democrats 9 have an unfavorable opinion of both parties Still the share of independents who view both parties negatively has declined in recent years At one point in 2015 more than a third of independents 36 viewed both parties unfavorably Most of the change since then has come among Republican leaning independents who feel much more positively about the GOP than they did then In July 2015 just 44 of GOP leaners had a favorable opinion of the Republican Party 47 had an unfavorable view of both parties Today a majority of GOP leaners view the Republican Party favorably 55 while just 24 view both parties unfavorably Independents who do not lean to a party are most likely to have an unfavorable opinion of both parties 37 Another 22 have favorable opinions of both parties Just 11 of independents who do not lean to a party view the Democratic Party favorably while about as many 9 have a favorable view of the GOP Over the past two decades Republicans and Democrats have come to view the opposing party more negatively The same trend is evident among independents who lean toward a party Currently 87 of those who identify with the Republican Party view the Democratic Party unfavorably Republican leaning independents are almost as likely to view the Democratic Party negatively 81 unfavorable Opinions among Democrats and Democratic leaners are nearly the mirror image 88 of Democrats and 84 of Democratic leaners view the GOP unfavorably In both parties the shares of partisan identifiers and leaners with unfavorable impressions of the opposition party are at or near all time highs Perhaps more important intense dislike of the opposing party which has surged over the past two decades among partisans has followed a similar trajectory among independents who lean toward the Republican and Democratic parties The share of Democratic leaning independents with a very unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party has more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2018 from 8 to 37 There has been a similar trend in how Republican leaners view the Democratic Party very unfavorable opinions have increased from 15 in 1994 to 39 in 2018 Fact Tank01 17 2019 Fact Tank09 06 2018 Fact Tank11 28 2018 Internet Tech03 01 2018

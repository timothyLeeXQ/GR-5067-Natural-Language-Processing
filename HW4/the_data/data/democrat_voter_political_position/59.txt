RICHMOND Va Off year General Assembly elections do not typically move the needle for most voters but that is far from the case in 2019 With a thin Republican majority on the line the stakes for the future of Virginia s state house have not been this high in many years Following the Blue Wave election in 2017 fueled in part by the election of President Donald Trump Democrats almost completely eliminated a near Republican super majority in the House Virginia Democrats are eyeing key races in suburban areas across the state including Richmond to continue that momentum and flip control of the legislature in their favor With Democratic Governor Ralph Northam in the Executive Mansion control of both chambers would mean Democrats could finally pursue their key agenda items like gun control and anti discrimination policy many liberals feel Republicans have long scuttled WATCH BATTLEGROUND VIRGINIA INTERVIEWS WITH THE CANDIDATES Republicans are fighting against demographic changes across Virginia but are not backing down from the election year fight Republican leaders have pointed to sound budgeting decision teacher pay raises and tax reform as examples of their effective leadership Also Virginia conservatives anticipate backlash from blackface scandals involving Northam D and Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring plus sexual assault allegations against Democratic Lt Governor Justin Fairfax will help dampen the enthusiasm Democrats felt coming into 2019 In the House of Delegates a U S Supreme Court ruling earlier this year found 2011 maps were racially gerrymandered so court drawn maps are in place for this election that make it harder for Republicans to defend their majority nonpartisan studies found Election Day is Tuesday November 5 and all 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for grabs Republicans hold a 20 19 margin in the State Senate and a 51 48 margin in the House of Delegates The party that wins control in November will control the state budgeting process heavily influence the outcome of a special session on gun violence prevention scheduled to resume after the election and lead the process to redraw Virginia legislative and congressional maps following the 2020 census An April survey by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University found voters were tuned into the upcoming elections The party that

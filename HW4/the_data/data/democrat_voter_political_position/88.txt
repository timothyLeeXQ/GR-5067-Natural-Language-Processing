It s likely that in some jurisdictions you can register as Communist or Socialist When you actually vote you can vote for any candidate on your ballot or write in a candidate of your choice for a specific race Your registration with a particular party can determine which primary election you can vote in but not always Some places have open primaries where a Republican can choose to vote in the Democratic primary and vice versa Other places require you to Contrary to the belief in the first question no voter is required to register for any political party whatsoever Voters can register as unenrolled or as members of any registered political party be they Democrats Republicans Greens Libertarians even the United States Pirate Party In states with closed primaries only voters enrolled in their party can vote in the party primaries States with open primaries allow unenrolled voters to vote in whatever primary they want My state of Massachusetts has open primaries which is the biggest reason why no party has more voters than the unenr sLsDMRpNGbEoJRLnRCsioJeaaWrTeCidQKBEg TXFybuynyOe rEZNexLoJhHkrBoUN fOjiqnmePGY Registering for a political party only dictates who you can vote for in the primaries and even then many states have open primaries meaning people can vote for any candidate regardless of their party affiliation or having no affiliation at all The purpose of the primary traditionally is to determine which candidate will represent the major party in the general election I say traditionally because in an open primary state it is quite common for the two highest vote getters in the primaries to belong to the same party In that way the general election operates more like a run off ele In the US voting is primarily organized at the state or county level so no assumption about what US voters do is likely to be valid nationwide Here in Washington state people do not register as Republican or Democrat Indeed even the candidates for roles other than the US presidency simply self identity as belonging to a particular party If for example someone on the ballot in WA state calls themselves a Democrat but they are a new candidate and you don t recognize their name it is good to verity with the Democratic party as to whether the party really endorses them or not For t In no state are you required to register as republican or democrat In states that have party registration you are not forced to register a party affiliation you just can t vote in the party primaries That s the only thing that party registration affects In states with closed primaries republicans can t vote to choose the democrat party nominee and democrats can t pick the Republican Party nominee In the general election where the various party nominees are up for the actual position against everyone else you can vote for who ever you want A registered democrate in the general electio sZotepXoTnWsWKtPnoCMkLOrcbeidZtnrc YcDAbKHXsZyPLQmV

2016 primary you could only get a republican primary ballot if you were registered as a republican The democrats were more lenient and there were a couple of parties besides democrat that you could get a democrat ballot It is not up to the state but up to the state democratic or republican PARTY to make the rules of who can vote for a candidate in their primary I was registered as an Independent for years and only switched in 2016 to be abl You don t have to declare a party It used to be you had to be registered Republican to help chose the Republican candidate by voting in the Republican primay Registered Democratc to vote in the Democrat primary The same with other parties Independents and decline to state had no say Not any more I think there should be no Presidential primaries The parties should come up with other ways to chose their candidate that do not use government elections and subject them to State election rules like open primaries They need to ensure that only party members have input on chosing the candidat You are sadly misinformed about voter registration in the US Folks in the US who register to vote are not required to register as Democrat or Republican or as any other political party Registration can be done as Independent or in some states no political party The point of registering as any political party is that in some states the primary elections those held to determine the nominees of a political party for the several elected positions are closed primaries That is only those voters who have registered as in a particular party are allowed to vote in that party s primary elect Nobody HAS to Register as either Dem or Repub You CAN register independent or one of the minor parties You ONLY get to vote in the Primary of a party you d registered with I am a Registered Dem but I CAN vote for a Repub or write in Willie Nelson if I want You DON T have to register as Republican or Democrat You have to register to vote that s it There is no law saying you have to be registered as one thing or another You re sadly misinformed Registering with a political party is purely optional

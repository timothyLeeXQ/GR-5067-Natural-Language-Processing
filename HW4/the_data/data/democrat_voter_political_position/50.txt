By Matt Arco NJ Advance Media for NJ com New Jersey is a Democratic leaning state and Democrats are adding to their totals at a faster pace than Republicans But the GOP is far from obsolete in the Garden State and still maintains pockets of control in some counties Republicans are outnumbered by registered Democrats by nearly 895 000 people according to the latest statistics from the state s Division of Elections As of the end of April New Jersey had 2 144 044 registered Democrats and 1 249 230 Republicans Over the past year Democrats added 95 733 voters compared to the GOP s 40 103 according to the data However registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in six of the state s 21 counties and there several other counties that are pretty evenly split While President Donald Trump lost New Jersey by 14 points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 nine counties tipped in the Republican s favor And in Democrat Phil Murphy s landslide in last year s governor s race eight counties went for Republican Kim Guadagno The largest number of New Jersey voters 2 381 558 to be exact have not formally claimed any party affiliation That s a drop of about 20 000 voters But pollsters who know such things say the breakdown of these unaffiliated voters is pretty close to the Democrat Republican split So how many of your neighbors break blue or lean right Here is a county by county breakdown of which political party rules in each of New Jersey s 21 counties and how much each party gained since this time last year Democrats 60 087 Republicans 46 034 Unaffiliated 73 786 Clinton won by 7 points against Trump in Atlantic County and went for Phil Murphy last year But the county went for Republican Gov Chris Christie in 2009 and 2013 Both Democrats and Republicans added new voters to their rolls in the past year Atlantic County added 2 813 Democrats and 1 225 Republicans from April 2017 It s possible some of those new registrants were unaffiliated voters who turned either Democrat or Republican Atlantic County lost 447 unaffiliated voters since that time Democrats 212 595 Republicans 127 046 Unaffiliated 256 269 Bergen County is the most populated county in the

The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States The party describes itself as supporting American liberalism and American progressivism The party incorporates centrists 1 2 3 4 liberals and progressives 5 6 as well as more left wing or socialist movements many aligned with the presidential campaign of independent Senator Bernie Sanders 7 There is also a small Conservative wing represented in the house by the Blue Dog Coalition although Conservative Democrat ideology is different from the traditional Conservatism the Republican party supports Policies of past Democratic platforms have sought to protect social programs labor unions consumer protection and workplace safety regulation equal opportunity and racial equality 8 and regulation against pollution of the environment 9 10 11 Democrats support abortion rights and the LGBTQ community tend to support an easier pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants Democrats tend to agree with the scientific consensus on climate change and support clean energy and cap and trade policies Equal economic opportunity and a base social safety net provided by the welfare state and strong labor unions have historically been at the heart of Democratic economic policy 8 The party pursues a mixed economy albeit with more government intervention and regulation in the economy 12 Democrats generally support a progressive tax system higher minimum wages social security universal health care public education and public housing 8 They also support infrastructure development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation while stimulating private sector job creation 13 Also however since the 1990s the party has occasionally supported centrist economic reforms which cut the size of government and reduced market regulations 14 The party has continuously rejected laissez faire economics instead favoring a Social Market Economy to ensure a true Free Market and equality of opportunity Democrats support a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce economic inequality by making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay the highest amount in taxes 15 They also support more government spending on social services while spending less on the military 16 17 They oppose cutting social services such as Social Security as well as Medicare Medicaid and various other welfare programs 18 believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice Democrats believe the benefits of social services in monetary and non monetary terms are a more productive labor force and that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes especially on top earners or cuts to social services Furthermore Democrats view social services as essential towards providing positive freedom i e freedom derived from economic opportunity The Democratic led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO pay as you go budget rule early in the 110th Congress 19 Democrats favor raising the minimum wage and believe that all Americans have the right to a fair wage They call for a 15 00 hour national minimum wage and believe that the minimum wage should be adjusted regularly 20 The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the party s agenda during the 110th Congress In 2006 Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage all six initiatives passed 21 Democrats call for affordable and quality health care and many advocate on expanding government intervention in this area They favor a movement toward universal health care in a variety of forms to address the rising costs of modern health insurance Democratic politicians like Representatives John Conyers and John Dingell have called for a single payer program or Medicare for All The Progressive Democrats of America a group operating inside the Democratic Party has made single payer universal health care one of their primary policy goals 22 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23 2010 has been one of the most significant pushes for universal health care to become a reality As of April 2014 more than 10 million Americans have enrolled in healthcare coverage since the Affordable Care Act was launched 23 Democrats favor improving public education by raising school standards and reforming the head start program They also support universal preschool and expanding access to primary education some Democrats who support this through charter schools They call for slashes in student loan debt and support reforms to force down tuition fees 24 Other proposed reforms have included nationwide universal preschool education tuition free or reduced tuition college and reforms of standardized testing Democrats have the long term aim of having low cost publicly funded college education with low tuition fees like in much of Europe and Canada which should be available to every eligible American student Alternatively they encourage expanding access to post secondary education by increasing state funding for student financial aid such as Pell Grants and college tuition tax deductions 25 Democrats tend to support the Common Core State Standards and oppose school choice Democrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of environmentalism In more recent years this stance has had as its emphasis alternative energy generation as the basis for an improved economy greater national security and general environmental benefits 26 The Democratic Party also favors expanding conservation lands and it encourages open space and rail travel to relieve highway and airport congestion and improve air quality and economy it believe s that communities environmental interests and government should work together to protect resources while ensuring the vitality of local economies Once Americans were led to believe they had to make a choice between the economy and the environment They now know this is a false choice 27 The Democratic Party s most important environmental concern is climate change Democrats most notably former Vice President Al Gore have pressed for stern regulation of greenhouse gases On October 15 2007 Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to build greater knowledge about man made climate change and laying the foundations for the measures needed to counteract these changes asserting that the climate crisis is not a political issue it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity 28 A 2017 study by the Center for American Progress Action Fund of climate change denial in the U S Congress found that 180 members deny the science behind climate change all Republicans and that no Democratic members of Congress publicly denied climate change 29 30 Democrats support increased domestic renewable energy development including wind and solar power farms in an effort to reduce carbon pollution The party s platform calls for an all of the above energy policy including clean energy natural gas and domestic oil while wanting to become energy independent 21 The party has supported higher taxes on oil companies and increased regulations on coal power plants favoring a policy of reducing long term reliance on fossil fuels 31 32 Additionally the party supports stricter fuel emissions standards to prevent air pollution The 2012 Democratic Party platform endorses fair and

immigration electoral reform and women s reproductive rights The Democratic Party strive for equality of outcome for all Americans regardless of sex age race ethnicity sexual orientation gender identity religion creed or national origin Many Democrats support affirmative action programs to further this goal Democrats also strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability As such they pushed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 a legal expansion that became law 37 The 2012 Democratic Party platform believes the right to vote and to have ones vote counted is an essential American freedom and oppose laws placing unnecessary restrictions on those seeking to exercise that freedom such as voter ID laws 33 38 Many Democrats also support automatic voter registration which ensures that all Americans over the legal voting age are registered to vote upon reaching the aforementioned age and are never required to re register The 2012 Democratic Party platform endorses maintaining Roe v Wade a woman s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy including a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to

are required to record it in the State Department s annual report on human rights and the United States Department of State funding a program financing LGBT rights organizations to combat discrimination violence and other abuses is also present Since 2011 the party opposed the Defense of Marriage Act The party also opposes discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same sex couples seeking the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples and efforts by other nations criminalizing homosexual conduct or ignore abuse 33 39 40 The 2016 Democratic Party Platform declares We are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico Many stem from the fundamental question of Puerto Rico s political status Democrats believe that the people of Puerto Rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the Constitution laws and policies of the United States Democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity and good paying jobs for the hardworking people of Puerto Rico We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare Medicaid and other programs that benefit families Puerto Ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws just as they should be treated equally All American citizens no matter where they reside should have the right to vote for the President of the United States Finally we believe that federal officials must respect Puerto Rico s local self government as laws are implemented and Puerto Rico s budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity 41 excessive quote With a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968 the Brady Bill of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994 However some Democrats especially rural Southern and Western Democrats favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned that the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue 42 In the national platform for 2008 the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban 43 The 2012 Democratic Party platform endorses the death penalty but believes it must not be arbitrary DNA testing should be used in all appropriate circumstances defendants should have effective assistance of counsel and the administration of justice should be fair and impartial 33 The 2016 Democratic Platform however supports abolition of the death penalty 44 Many Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the U S military and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the U S from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions Democrats contend that torture is inhumane decreases the United States moral standing in the world and produces questionable results Democrats largely spoke out against waterboarding citation needed Torture became a very divisive issue in the party after Barack Obama was elected president Many centrist Democrats and members of the party s leadership supported the use of torture while the more left leaning wings continued to be steadfastly opposed to it 45 The Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a right to privacy For example many Democrats have opposed the NSA warrantless surveillance of U S citizens Some Democratic officeholders have championed consumer protection laws that limit the sharing of consumer data between corporations Most Democrats oppose sodomy laws and believe that government should not regulate consensual noncommercial sexual conduct among adults as a matter of personal privacy 46 Many Democrats are opposed to the Patriot Act However when the law was passed most Democrats were supportive of it and all but two Democrats in the U S Senate voted for the original legislation in 2001 The lone nay vote was from Russ Feingold of Wisconsin Mary Landrieu of Louisiana did not vote In the House the Democrats voted for the Act by a margin of 145 62 Democrats split on the issue of the Act s renewal in 2006 In the Senate 34 Democrats voted for the 2006 renewal and 9 against In the House 66 Democrats voted for the renewal and 124 against 47 better source needed In foreign policy the voters of the two major parties have largely overlapped since the 1990s The Gallup poll in early 2013 shows broad agreement on the top issues albeit with some divergence regarding as human rights and international cooperation through agencies such as the UN 48 In June 2014 the Quinnipiac Poll asked Americans which foreign policy they preferred Democrats chose A over B by 65 32 Republicans chose A over B by 56 to 39 independents chose A over B by 67 to 29 49 The only possible foreign policy difference between the parties consists of the size of the budget of the Department of Defense more specifically the United States military In 2002 Congressional Democrats were divided on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 147 voted against it 21 in the Senate and 126 in the House and 110 voted for it 29 in the Senate 81 in the House Since then many prominent Democrats such as former Senator John Edwards have expressed regret about this decision and have called it a mistake while others such as Senator Hillary Clinton have criticized the conduct of the war but did not repudiate their initial vote for it though Clinton later went on to do so during the party s 2008 presidential primaries Referring to Iraq in April 2007 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the war to be lost while other Democrats especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle accused President Bush of lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq Among lawmakers Democrats are the most vocal opponents of Operation Iraqi Freedom and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the 2006 mid term elections A March 2003 CBS News poll taken a few days before the invasion of Iraq found that 34 of Democrats nationwide would support it without United Nations backing 51 would support it only with its backing and 14 would not support it at all 50 The Los Angeles Times stated in early April 2003 that 70 of Democrats supported the decision to invade while 27 opposed it 51 The Pew Research Center stated in August 2007 that opposition increased from 37 during the initial invasion to 74 52 In April 2008 a CBS News poll found that about 90 of Democrats disapproved of the Bush administration s conduct and want to end the war within the next year 53 Democrats in the House of Representatives near unanimously supported a non binding resolution disapproving of President Bush s decision to send additional troops into Iraq in 2007 Congressional Democrats overwhelmingly supported military funding legislation that included a provision that set a timeline for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq by March 31 2008 but also would leave combat forces in Iraq for purposes such as targeted counter terrorism operations 54 55 After a veto from the president and a failed attempt in Congress to override the veto 56 the U S Troop Readiness Veterans Care Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act 2007 was passed by Congress and signed by the president after the timetable was dropped Criticism of the Iraq War subsided after the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 led to a dramatic decrease in Iraqi violence The Democratic controlled 110th Congress continued to fund efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan Presidential candidate Barack Obama advocated a withdrawal of combat troops within Iraq by late 2010 with a residual force of peacekeeping troops left in place 57 He stated that both the speed of withdrawal and the number of troops left over would be entirely conditions based 57 On February 27 2009 President Obama announced As a candidate for president I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we ve made and protect our troops Those consultations are now complete and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months 58 Around 50 000 non combat related forces will remain 58 Obama s plan drew wide bipartisan support including that of defeated Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain 58 The Democratic Party has been critical of Iran s nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government In 2013 the Democratic led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear weapon program in exchange for international economic sanction relief 59 As of 2014 negotiations had been successful and the party called for more cooperation with Iran in the future 60 In 2015 the Obama administration agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which provides sanction relief in exchange for international oversight of the Iranian nuclear program Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate near unanimously voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States in Afghanistan in 2001 supporting the NATO coalition invasion of the nation Most elected Democrats continue to support the Afghanistan conflict and some such as a Democratic National Committee spokesperson have voiced concerns that the Iraq War shifted too many resources away from the presence in Afghanistan 61 62 63 Since 2006 then candidate Barack Obama called for a surge of troops into Afghanistan and since 2008 Republican candidate John McCain also called for a surge 63 As President Obama sent a surge force of additional troops to Afghanistan citation needed Troop levels were at 94 000 in December 2011 and are decreasing as of recent years with a target of 68 000 by fall 2012 Obama plans to bring all the troops home by 2014 64 Support for the war among the American people has diminished over time and many Democrats have changed their opinion and now oppose a continuation of the conflict 65 66 In July 2008 Gallup found that 41 of Democrats called the invasion a mistake while a 55 majority disagreed in contrast Republicans were more supportive of the war The survey described Democrats as evenly divided about whether or not more troops should be sent 56 support it if it would mean removing troops from Iraq and only 47 support it otherwise 66 A CNN survey in August 2009 stated that a majority of Democrats now oppose the war CNN polling director Keating Holland said Nearly two thirds of Republicans support the war in Afghanistan Three quarters of Democrats oppose the war 65 An August 2009 Washington Post poll found similar results and the paper stated that Obama s policies would anger his closest supporters 67 The 2012 Democratic Party platform endorses maintaining commitment to Israel s security claiming a strong and secure Israel is vital because of strategic interests and common values the Obama administration providing nearly 10 billion to Israel in the past three years military support for Israel such as the Iron Dome system the Egypt Israel Peace Treaty the Israel Jordan peace treaty and recognizing Jerusalem as and remains the capital of Israel and opposes any attempt to delegitimize Israel on the world stage The platform also states that Democratic Party seeks peace between Israelis and Palestinians and supports a two state solution under conditions that Israel s security concerns are met and any Palestinian partner must recognize Israel s right to exist reject violence and adhere to existing agreements 33

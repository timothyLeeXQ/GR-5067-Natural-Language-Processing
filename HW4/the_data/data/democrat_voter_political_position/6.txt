the Democratic primary season hasn t been about the Democratic primary at all but about the fallout from a 35 year old racist photo on a yearbook page Gov Ralph Northam of Virginia was pummeled on social media after the revelation and virtually every Democratic presidential candidate demanded his resignation Yet the majority of ordinary Democrats in Virginia said Mr Northam should remain in office according to a Washington Post Schar School poll a week later And black Democrats were likelier than white ones to say Mr Northam should remain Today s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its woke left wing But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate The outspoken group of Democratic leaning voters on social media is outnumbered roughly 2 to 1 by the more moderate more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don t post political content online according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project This latter group has the numbers to decide the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of a relatively moderate establishment favorite as it has often done in the past Even these results might understate the leftward lean of the most politically active Democratic Twitter users who often engage with political journalists and can have a powerful effect in shaping the conventional wisdom In an informal poll of Democrats on one of our Twitter accounts on Monday about 80 percent said they were liberal and a similar percentage said they had a college degree Only 20 percent said political correctness was a problem and only 2 percent said they were black The relative moderation of Democrats who are not sharing their political thoughts on social media and therefore of Democrats as a whole makes it less surprising that Virginia Democrats tolerated Mr Northam s yearbook page It makes it easier to imagine how Joe Biden might not merely survive questions about whether he touched women in ways that made them feel uncomfortable but might even emerge essentially unscathed It also helps explain why recent polls show that a majority of Democrats would rather see the party become more moderate than move leftward even as progressives clamor for a Green New Deal or Medicare for all The Hidden Tribes Project conducted by More in Common is a nonpartisan representative YouGov survey of 8 000 Americans that divided respondents into different groups or tribes based on their responses to dozens of questions The characteristics of these groups help make sense of the different ways Democrats have run and won primary elections In reality the Democratic electorate is both ideologically and demographically diverse Over all around half of Democratic leaning voters consider themselves moderate or conservative not liberal Around 40 percent are not white Roughly a quarter of Democrats count as ideologically consistent progressives who toe the party line or something further to the left on just about every issue Only a portion of them perhaps 1 in 10 Democrats over all might identify as Democratic socialists based on recent polls Traditional liberals another relatively white well educated bloc of Democrats are also overrepresented on social media They re united with the progressive activists on the issues that divide Republicans and Democrats They split on whether American society is fundamentally and unacceptably unjust with liberals optimistic about compromise and satisfied with a cautious approach and progressives demanding bolder action to redress injustice in society The candidates of the progressive left whether Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio Cortez speak with moral clarity The strongest traditional liberal candidates despite their pragmatic streak speak with hopeful idealism stemming from their relatively optimistic view of the country s capacity to compromise reform and change Barack Obama took that tack in 2008 and Beto O Rourke and Cory Booker might hope to in 2020 In recent decades most of the candidates who have found their core strength among the party s ideologically consistent left liberal activist base have lost Gary Hart Jerry Brown Jesse Jackson Howard Dean and Mr Sanders all fell short against candidates of the party s establishment like Walter Mondale Al Gore and Hillary Clinton The establishment candidates won the nomination by counting on the rest of the party s voters The rest of the party is easy to miss Not only is it less active on social media but it is also under represented in the well educated urban enclaves where journalists roam It is under represented in the Northern blue states and districts where most Democratic politicians win elections Many in this group are party stalwarts people who are Democrats because of identity and self interest a union worker an African American more than their policy views Their votes are concentrated in the South where Democratic politicians rarely win 40 45 50 55 60 Nonwhite voters particularly black voters are a major driver of this geographic split Black voters represent around 20 percent of the Democratic electorate nationwide and a majority of Democrats in the Deep South Mr Obama s strength among black voters allowed him to defeat the establishment favorite candidate Mrs Clinton in 2008 in contrast with prior progressive candidates The rest of the party poses a challenge for more progressive candidates and it s not just about this group s moderate views Less engaged and less ideological voters tend to be cynical about politics One might think cynicism would translate to support for outsider candidates and it probably could against an establishment favorite with enough flaws Instead it has more often meant skepticism of ambitious and idealistic liberals and progressives who offer big promises with no record It has meant an appreciation for well known battle tested politicians who have been on their side or even delivered in the past This election cycle Mr Biden might be the beneficiary of such sentiment This group s lower levels of news consumption mean fewer opportunities for the activist backed candidates to make their case A majority of such voters might not even have an opinion about Ms Ocasio Cortez over all only around half of Democrats do in recent polls Their weaker ideological predilections mean these voters are often less likely to buy the message even if it reaches them Of course the Democratic Party has moved to the left in recent years It has moved far enough left that there s plenty of room for a progressive candidate to win the nomination It would be a mistake to dismiss Mr Sanders s chances of winning the nomination just because white progressives have generally fallen short in the past The name recognition he earned in 2016 will be an asset that prior outsider candidates haven t been able to count on and so will his impressive small donor fund raising But it would also be a mistake to assume that outrage on social media means outrage throughout the broader electorate And it would be a mistake to assume that more moderate Democrats are out of step with the party s electorate Illustrations by Sergio Peçanha based in part on ProPublica s Weepeople additional work by Josh Katz Advertisement

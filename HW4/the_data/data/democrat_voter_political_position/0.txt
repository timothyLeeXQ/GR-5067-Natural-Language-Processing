 Political party strength in U S states refers to the level of representation of the various political parties of the U S in each statewide elective office providing legislators to the state and to the U S Congress and electing the executives at the state U S state governor and national U S President level Throughout most of the 20th century although the Republican and Democratic parties alternated in power at a national level some states were so overwhelmingly dominated by one party that nomination was usually tantamount to election This was especially true in the Solid South where the Democratic Party was dominant for the better part of a century from the end of Reconstruction in the late 1870s through the period of Jim Crow Laws into the 1960s Conversely the New England states of Vermont Maine and New Hampshire were dominated by the Republican Party as were some Midwestern states like Iowa and North Dakota However in the 1970s and 1980s the increasingly conservative Republican Party gradually overtook the Democrats in the southeast The Democrats support in the formerly Solid South had been eroded during the vast cultural political and economic upheaval that surrounded the 1960s By the 1990s the Republican Party had completed the transition into the southeast s dominant political party despite typically having fewer members due to the prevalence of Republican voting generational Democrats In New England the opposite trend took place the former Republican strongholds of Maine and Vermont became solidly Democratic as did formerly Republican areas of New Jersey New York and Connecticut Currently the majority of the overall number of seats held in the state legislatures has been switching between the two parties every few years As of the U S gubernatorial elections of 2010 the Republican party holds an outright majority of approximately 440 with 3 890 seats 53 of total compared to the Democratic party s number of 3 450 47 of total seats elected on a partisan ballot 1 Of the 7 382 seats in all of the state legislatures combined independents and third parties account for only 16 members not counting the 49 members of the Nebraska Legislature which is the only legislature in the nation to hold non partisan elections to determine its members Due to the results of the 2010 elections Republicans took control of an additional 19 state legislative chambers giving them majority control of both chambers in 25 states versus the Democrats majority control of both chambers in only 16 states with 8 states having split or inconclusive control of both chambers not including Nebraska previous to the 2010 elections it was Democrats who controlled both chambers in 27 states versus the Republican party having total control in only 14 states with eight states divided and Nebraska being nonpartisan 2 As of September 2019 Gallup polling found that 31 of Americans identified as Democrat 29 identified as Republican and 38 as Independent 3 Additionally polling showed that 49 are either Democrats or Democratic leaners and 44 are either Republicans or Republican leaners when Independents are asked do you lean more to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party 3 In 2018 the number of competitive states dropped down to 10 the lowest number since 2008 From 2017 to 2018 New Hampshire Nevada and Pennsylvania moved from competitive to lean Democratic while West Virginia Louisiana and Indiana moved from competitive to lean Republican and Nebraska moved from lean Republican to competitive 4 As of 2018 Massachusetts was the most Democratic state with 56 of residents identifying as Democrat while only 27 of residents identified as Republican Wyoming was the most Republican state with 59 of residents identifying as Republican and only 25 of residents identifying as Democrat 4 Another metric to measure how much a state leans towards one party or the other is the Cook Partisan Voting Index PVI Cook PVIs are calculated by comparing a state s average Democratic Party or Republican Party share of the two party presidential vote in the past two presidential elections to the nation s average share of the same PVIs for the states over time can be used to show the trends of U S states towards or away from one party or the other 6 The following table shows all the U S states and to what party Democratic or Republican their state governors belong Also indicated is the majority party of the state legislatures upper and lower houses as well as U S Senate representation Nebraska s legislature is unicameral i e it has only one legislative house and is officially non partisan though party affiliation still has an unofficial influence on the legislative process The simplest measure of the party strength in a state s voting population is the breakdown by party totals from its voter registration figures figures that can easily be obtained from the websites of the Secretaries of State or the Boards of Elections of the various states As of 2019 update 28 states and the District of Columbia allow registered voters to indicate a party preference when registering to vote the following 20 states mostly in the South and the Midwest do not provide for party preferences in voter registration Alabama Arkansas Georgia Hawaii Illinois Indiana Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana North Dakota Ohio South Carolina Tennessee Texas Vermont Virginia Washington and Wisconsin The partisan breakdown demographics provided in the following table are obtained from that state s party registration figures from late 2014 whenever possible where indicated 7 Only Wyoming has a majority of registered voters identifying themselves as Republicans two states have a majority of registered voters identifying themselves as Democrats Maryland and Kentucky since 2010 Louisiana Pennsylvania and West Virginia have all seen their Democratic majority registrations slip to just Democratic pluralities For those states that do not allow for registration by party Gallup s annual polling of voter party identification by state is the next best metric of party strength in the U S states The partisan figures in the table below for the 22 states that don t register voters by party come from Gallup s 2017 polling of voter party identification by state 6 1 1 b g 4 3 1 b g a The Alaska House of Representatives is controlled by a coalition of 15 Democrats 6 Republicans and 2 Independents b Vacancy c While the Nebraska Legislature is technically non partisan the majority of its Senators are de

party registration figures provided whenever possible e Indicated partisan breakdown numbers are from the Party Identification by State figures for 2014 from Gallup polling note Gallup figures have been rounded to two significant figures on the assumption that figures from polling are less accurate than registration by party figures 36 f Senators Bernie Sanders I VT and Angus King I ME are independents however they caucus with Senate Democrats and as such are included in that party s total number of Senators for the purposes of calculating partisan breakdown in this article g The US House of Representatives currently consists of 234 Democrats 197 Republicans and 1 Independent Rep Justin Amash I MI 03 who was elected as a Republican but left the party on July 4 2019 3 seats are vacant WI 07 held by Republican Rep Sean Duffy until his September 23 2019 resignation NY 27 represented by Republican Rep Chris Collins until his October 1 2019 resignation and MD 07 held by

and regional political circumstances often influence party strength The following figure is for Governors as of December 10 2019 update The following figures for party control of state legislative chambers are as of January 2019 update The following is based on the results of the 2016 Presidential election The following are the current standings in the U S Senate and in the U S House as of the 116th Congress The following table shows how many state legislatures were controlled outright by each party 41 The following table shows how many governorships were controlled outright by each party

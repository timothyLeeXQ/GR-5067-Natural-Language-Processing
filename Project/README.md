# Natural Language Processing with the Book of Psalms

## Project Abstract
The Book of Psalms, a part of the Old Testament, is of high religious significance in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Scholarship attracted to the Bible and Book of Psalms for this reason have mostly relied on humanistic approaches from literature and history. The emergence of computational criticism in the highly related field of literary analysis suggests the promise of computational approaches for biblical analysis. This study is a preliminary exploration of this idea. An unsupervised machine learning technique, Latent Dirchlet Allocation (LDA), is applied to the Book of Psalms with each psalm as a text document. Output from the LDA model is used for thematic discovery and exploring type distinctions in relation to traditional biblical research on these issues. The LDA model seemed to affirm themes identified in Form-Critical theory. However, it was difficult to draw conclusions regarding psalm types, with multiple potential reasons for the pattern of results uncovered. Despite these findings, the questions opened by the study and finding limitations offer further opportunities for research, affirming the promise that computational methods have in developing our understanding of biblical texts.
